NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT
OF FINANCIAL SERVICES 

In the Matter of
DEUTSCHE BANK AG and
DEUTSCHE BANK AG NEW YORK BRANCH

CONSENT ORDER UNDER 
NEW YORK BANKING LAW §§ 39, 44 and 44-a

The New York State Department of Financial Services (the "Department"),
Deutsche Bank AG and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch (the "New York Branch"),
(together, "Deutsche Bank," or the "Bank"), agree: 

Introduction 

The Culture of Compliance in the Age of Risk 

  1. Global financial institutions serve as the first line of defense against illegal
financial transactions in today's fast-paced, interconnected financial network. New York
and federal law require these institutions to design, implement, and execute policies and
systems to prevent and detect illegal financial transactions. The Bank Secrecy Act
("BSA"), for example, requires these institutions to report suspicious transactions (via
"Suspicious Activity Reports" or "SARs") to the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial
Crimes Enforcement Network ("FinCEN"), enabling law enforcement to conduct
investigations that result in the future interdiction of these transactions and, ultimately,
prosecution or the blocking ofbad actors. The BSA likewise requires financial institutions
to have adequate anti-money laundering ("AML") systems in place. 

2. New York law imposes these same requirements on its regulated financial
institutions. 1 Specifically, the law obligates financial institutions to devise and implement
systems reasonably designed to identify and block suspicious activity and transactions
prohibited by law. Each institution is expected to configure a system based on the
particular risks faced by the institution, considering such factors as its size, geographical
reach, and specific lines of business. Moreover, the institution must employ or engage
sufficient numbers of trained compliance professionals to ensure that its systems run
properly.

  3. To strengthen anti-money laundering efforts, New York law imposes
additional requirements on regulated institutions, obligating them to maintain effective
programs to monitor and filter transactions to screen for money laundering and bar
transactions with sanctioned entities. 2 Additionally, to both protect consumers and the
safety and soundness of financial institutions, the Department has proposed regulations
requiring regulated entities to adopt a series of measures to prevent against cyber attacks. 3

4. Ultimate responsibility for design and implementation of such policies and
systems belongs at the institution's top echelon. The board of directors and senior
management must devote careful study to the design of the anti-money laundering and
other compliance systems that lie at the core of this first line of defense, and must ensure
sufficient resources to undergird these systems and structures. Adequate staffing must be
put in place, and training must be ongoing. 

  5. Summary of Findings: As set forth more fully below, this Consent Order
addresses serious compliance deficiencies identified in the Department's investigation that
spanned Deutsche Bank's global enterprise. These flaws allowed a corrupt group of bank
traders and offshore entities to improperly and covertly transfer more than $10 billion out
of Russia, by conscripting Deutsche Bank operations in Moscow, London and New York
to their improper purpose.

  6. The suspicious security trading schemes identified - termed "mirror trades"
-permitted this corrupt consortium to move very large sums of money out of Russia under
the radar and without the scrutiny ofDeutsche Bank's compliance function. By converting
rubles into dollars through security trades that had no discernible economic purpose, the
scheme was a means for bad actors within a financial institution to achieve improper ends
while evading compliance with applicable laws.

  7. Afflicted with inadequate AML control policies, procedures, and structures,
Deutsche Bank missed several key opportunities to identify and interdict this scheme.
Moreover, the suspicious mirror-trading machinations occurred at a time Deutsche Bank
was on clear notice of numerous deficiencies in its BSA/ AML systems and management,
and yet the steps it took to remediate the situation proved seriously inadequate.
8. For these reasons, the Department has entered into this Consent Order with
the consent and agreement of Deutsche Bank to resolve this matter as set forth below and
without further proceedings. 

Factual Findings

The Mirror-Trading Scheme at Deutsche Bank's
Moscow, London and New York Offices 

  9. The Mirrm·-Trading" Scheme: The "mirror trading" scheme at issue
here was simple and effective. Deutsche Bank Trust Company of the Americas
("DBTCA"), an entity located at 60 Wall Street, New York, New York which is licensed
and supervised by the Department, was the entity through which the U.S. dollar payments
flowed to the suspicious entities involved here.

  10. Operating through the securities desk at Deutsche Bank's Moscow affiliate
("DB-Moscow"), certain companies that were clients of that desk routinely issued orders
to purchase Russian blue chip stocks, always paying in rubles. The size ofthe typical order
ranged in value from $2 to $3 million.

  11. Shortly thereafter - indeed, sometimes the very same day - a related
counterparty would sell the identical Russian blue chip stock in the same quantity and at
the same price through Deutsche Bank's London branch ("DB-London"). The
counterparties to the trade were actually closely related on both sides, such as through
common ownership.

  12. None of these "mirror trades" demonstrated any legitimate economic
rationale. The counterparties frequently lost money on these trades, due to fees and
commissions that were substantially credited to DB-Moscow by Deutsche Bank pursuant
to the brokerage arrangements between Moscow and London.

  13. For example, typically, it made no difference to the counterparties the
particular security to be bought or sold. All that mattered was that there was a matching
trade available. In one instance, a counterparty representative, who was buying shares for 
one counterparty and selling the identical shares for a related counterparty, told a DBMoscow
trader, "/ have a billion rouble today . ... Will you be able to find a security for
this size?"

  14. In another case, a counterparty representative, when told by a DB-Moscow
trader there were no Sberbank Russian shares available for a mirror trade, immediately
switched the order to Gazprom Russian shares. No rationale for this switch was apparent;
no trading hypothesis was offered.

  15. Moreover, a number ofthe selling counterparties were registered in offshore
territories, like Cyprus or the British Virgin Islands. 4 The seller would be paid for its shares
in U.S. dollars, which were routinely cleared through DBTCA. Thus, by virtue of this
scheme, the counterparties were able to surreptitiously convert rubles into U.S. dollars
using Deutsche Bank.

  16. While offsetting trades are not inherently illegal, where - as here - they lack
obvious economic purpose and could be used to facilitate money laundering or other illicit
conduct, they are highly suggestive of financial crime.

  17. The scheme was well-developed, running between 2011 and early 2015. At
least 12 entities were involved in these suspicious trading activities, and the entities were
