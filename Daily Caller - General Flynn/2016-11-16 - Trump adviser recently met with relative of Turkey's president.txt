Last month, Donald Trump’s top military adviser, retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, met with two Turkish community leaders in New York City, one of whom has close ties to Turkish government agents, The Daily Caller has found.

Flynn, who served as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency between 2012 and 2014, met on Oct. 10 with Ibrahim Kurtulus and Hilal Mutlu.

Mutlu, who is a cousin of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is tied to groups that either receive funding from the Turkish government or have close connections to Erdogan and officials in his regime, a Daily Caller investigation reveals.

Kurtulus is a former official with the Assembly of Turkish American Associations, a U.S.-based non-profit. Active in New York’s Turkish community, Kurtulus tells The Daily Caller that he is not in any way affiliated with the Turkish government.

The revelation of the meeting comes on the heels of a report published by TheDC last week which found that a businessman who is the director of an economic board controlled by Turkey’s government recently used a Dutch shell company to hire Flynn’s consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, to lobby Congress.

Last week, on Election Day, Flynn published an op-ed at the website The Hill praising Erdogan and calling on the U.S. government to extradite one of the Turkish president’s biggest enemies, Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric who lives in self-exile in Pennsylvania.

The op-ed stoked suspicion from some foreign policy analysts since Flynn had never talked publicly about Gulen. The op-ed also marked a reversal of sorts for Flynn, who has criticized Turkey and Erdogan in the past for not doing enough to fight ISIS.

The lobbying contract and the meeting last month raise numerous questions for Flynn, who is reportedly being considered for Defense Secretary or National Security Advisor in the Trump administration.

The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that a source working on Trump’s transition team says Flynn’s vetting could prove difficult. The source also said that Flynn did not disclose his lobbying relationship with Inovo BV, the Dutch shell company which is controlled by Ekim Alptekin, the director of Turkey’s Foreign Economic Relations Board.

But Trump himself has not indicated that Flynn’s lobbying ties are concerning. The Republican invited Flynn to sit in on a Top Secret presidential daily briefinging at the White House on Tuesday.

In a Facebook post after the Oct. 10 meeting, Kurtulus bragged that he used the meeting as an opportunity to “educate” Flynn about Gulen, who Erdogan has accused of masterminding a July 15 coup against the Turkish government.

Erdogan has pressed the U.S. government to extradite Gulen back to Turkey to face charges of treason. The 76-year-old imam, who has lived in the Pocono mountains in Pennsylvania since 1999, has millions of followers worldwide — called Gulenists. He also controls his own vast network of U.S.-based non-profits. Top Gulen lieutenants donated heavily to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and to the Clinton Foundation.

Gulen’s opponents have dubbed him a terrorist, and they have moved to convince American policymakers and other leaders of the same.

“We had the opportunity to discuss important matters to NATO Ally of the Republic of Turkey. We discussed security, economic and other bilateral relations between US and the Republic of Turkey. I had the opportunity to educate more General Flynn about terrorist Fethullah Gulen,” Kurtulus wrote on Facebook after his Oct. 10 meeting with Flynn.

The meeting received almost no attention from the press. Alaturka, a U.S.-based Turkish news outlet, reported that Flynn discussed Gulen in the meeting with Kurtulus and other leaders in the U.S. Turkish community. Alaturka also published video of Kurtulus interviewing Flynn.

Kurtulus told TheDC that he told Flynn during their meeting about the Gulen network’s operation of a network of charter schools in the U.S. He also says he told Flynn that the Gulen movement is a “radical Islamist Trojan horse.” He also said that he is not a fan of Erdogan’s, though he has praised the Turkish leader’s response to the July 15 coup attempt.

Also at the meeting was Halil Mutlu, another prominent player in the deep network of pro-Erdogan U.S.-based activists. Mutlu, whose late father Kemal was Erdogan’s uncle, serves as president of a U.S.-based non-profit called the Turken Foundation.
