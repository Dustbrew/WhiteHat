Initial intent for the release of these articles was a slow, weekly release of each article published under the John Galt pseudonym. 
John Galt was chosen because during the FBI’s Vault 7 investigation.
They labeled Mr. Schulte an extremist due to his libertarian blog from high school.
He wrote about Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged, and opined the ideals of libertarianism.
For these views a decade ago, the FBI and United States Government shamefully deemed him a threat, an extremist against the State.
The following are Schulte’s 10 articles written in December 2017.
They were only recently recovered and typed.
Older drafts were posted at one point but these are the final versions he always wanted to share.

Possible quid pro quo between Laroche and Virginia DA? 
Laroche had previously approved travel to have Thanksgiving With the family in the city.
Family booked travel arrangements, planned outings to a Knicks game, a musical, comedy show. etc during the week of Thanksgiving. 
Once family arrived, Laroche called and rescinded the exemption.
Laroche planned for the arrest at the Manhattan apartment on Thanksgiving while family was in town.
Took the police several weeks to execute the arrest warrant.
Labeled a fugitive for a non-existent crime that allegedly happened two years ago. (April 2015 photos, right?)
Laroche denied request to relocate to Texas and re-establish internet access once it was almost in the final stages.
Govt argued bail conditions were breached due to unauthorized access of the Internet. 
Govt argued Virginia DA "found additional evidence" in the crime.
The DA told court-appointed attorney that the only evidence they had was what the FBI had given them.
Govt letter mentioned internet access based on Google account login data obtained from Google without a warrant.
Also, IP addresses that indicate TOR access obtained from Verizon without a search warrant. 
Cousin signed an affidavit and received approval from pretrial services. 
The web traffic and other evidence submitted to the court failed to mention that it could've been the cousin that accessed TOR.
Pretrial services inspected and approved the Verizon router installed at the Manhattan aparmtent, which the cousin could use.
FBI snooped on a private citizen (the cousin), and stole his Internet traffic data.
Pretrial services was informed that the Govt did not intend to give such “carte blanche authorization” to the cousin.
After speaking with court-appointed attorney, led back to the holding pen to await an appearance before the judge.
Remands to state custody due to being a “fugitive on arrest” (FOA).
Unable to travel to and handle charges to Virginia.
No coincidence in the arrest on the same day Laroche sends a letter to the court claiming bail conditions were vioalted.
They planned this from the very first day since released on bail. 
Brought to the second prison.
The conditions of the state prison system are horrid and appalling beyond belief. 
I’m thrown into a pen the size of a small room with about 12 other guys. 
Took 40 hours—a full work week—to get a cell and a bed from the first time arriving at the Manhattan Detention Center. 
Legal team decided to consent to federal remand on the conditions that I would be brought down to Virginia the following week.
Required to hire another attorney in Virginia.
Two simultaneous cases, both of which seek to deny bail, and remand throughout trial—a process that could take 2-3 years each. 
Two cases. 
Two jurisdictions. 
Two lawyers. 
Two bail hearings. 
So there are 4 possible outcomes:
00 — Lose in state court and get remanded; Lose in federal court and get remanded; RESULT: REMAND
01 — Lose in state court and get remanded; Win in federal court; RESULT: REMAND
10 — Win in state court; Lose in federal court and get remanded; RESULT: REMAND
11 — Win in both and get released on excessive bail with harsh, unlivable conditions; RESULT: FREEDOM
