most dangerous mole ever unmasked inside
US intelligence written by david wise
performed by kevin paris Oh prologue the
Russian raised his fourth glass of
Tullamore do the Irish whiskey favored
by his companion a grizzled veteran FBI
counter spy there was a chance however
slim that the Russian might provide a
clue to unmask the identity of the mole
inside American intelligence or he might
prove just another disappointment 27
times before the counter spy had
approached current and former KGB
officers with an offer of 1 million
dollars if they could unlock the mystery
of who had been leaking the innermost
secrets of the CIA and the FBI to Moscow
he was rebuffed each time the FBI
counterintelligence agent was a big man
well over 6 feet and rugged with the
physical presence that signaled in a bar
or anywhere else that it would not be a
good idea to mess with him he towered
over the Russian a former senior KGB
officer who had left the spy business 5
years earlier and was scrambling to make
a living after another glass of
Tullamore Dew the FBI agent led an
expensive cigar puffed away and listened
patiently for years like Ahab he had
tenaciously pursued the mole the unknown
traitor who had passed hundreds of
Secrets to Moscow over two decades and
cost the lives of Russian spies working
for the u.s. in the Irish bar on
Manhattan's East Side the evening seemed
to be going well with each drink the
Russian became more valuable but he
offered no clue at all to the identity
of the mole they met again soon after
that first night when the Russian
suddenly revealed that he was under a
death threat
from the Irkutsk mafia he was the
middleman for a caviar shipment worth
millions
that had spoiled enroute to New York the
people to whom the shipment was sent had
refused to pay as the middleman the
Russian mobsters warned he owed them
hundreds of thousands of dollars pay the
money they told him or we will kill you
