Chapter 14: The Spy Who Played Monopoly

(Need part 1 of 4)

to the tunnel it hired its own
contractor and started the digging which
went on for years at a cost said to have
reached hundreds of millions of dollars
the FBI gave the highly classified ultra
secret project a codename monopoly below
ground there were problems with
monopolies from the start one challenge
for the FBI was to figure out the path
of the tunnel the diggers could not
always be sure of the precise location
of their targets the problem was you
didn't know where you were going to come
up one FBI man said we had wiring
diagrams from a contractor source to
know where to dig he said we aimed the
tunnel so it would go to below an area
so heavily wired that we concluded this
was the communications area we had the
plans but you don't know what a room is
used for it might end up being a Xerox
room or a storage room what you want is
a coffee room where people talk or a
secure room where they think no one can
hear them
the British had provided us with silent
drills but we were concerned about
vibrations even though the drills were
silent another problem was that the
tunnel was below the water table the
tunnel builders had to deal with water
leaking into the tunnel a major problem
was disposing of the enormous amount of
displaced dirt but that was made much
easier by the construction going on all
around the site the fbi's dump trucks
blended in with the rest the National
Security Agency provided and manned the
sophisticated eavesdropping equipment
that was brought into the tunnel as
sections were completed but some of the
equipment did not work and the
technicians spent a lot of time trying
to figure out why Soviet countermeasures
were a likely explanation since the
Russians assumed all along that US
intelligence would attempt to bug their
embassy at least the tunnel was spacious
enough those who have been inside say a
person could easily stand up
it had sturdy walls and lights it was
not a dark and dank passageway like a
tourist
might expect to crawl through in an
underground cave the FBI gave very
secret VIP tours to show off the tunnel
to a select group of senior government
leaders including high-ranking officials
of the CIA a few members of the Senate
and
intelligence committees and visitors
from mi6 the British Secret Intelligence
Service and mi5 the British internal
security service you travelled through
it in little carts one visitor said when
the $70,000,000 Soviet embassy complex
was completed a decade later it included
the eight story Chancery Building faced
in white marble a nine story apartment
building and eight classroom school a
playground a gymnasium an Olympic sized
swimming pool a 400-seat auditorium an
underground parking garage and a large
reception hall in Moscow the KGB had
long been engaged in its own efforts to
bug the US Embassy in the Soviet capital
as far back as 1945 the Russians
presented ambassador Averell Harriman
with a carved replica of the Great Seal
of the United States the hollow wooden
seal had decorated the wall of four u.s.
ambassadors before the listening device
it concealed was discovered by the
Embassy's electronic sweepers in the
early 1950s the bug was highly
sophisticated it had no power source but
was activated by a microwave beamed from
outside the embassy much later
construction of the new American Embassy
in Moscow was halted in 1985 when it was
discovered that the building was riddled
with literally thousands of tiny bugs
the structure had in effect been turned
into a giant radio transmitter by the
KGB the russians had delivered huge
slabs of precast concrete with the bugs
already embedded within by the time the
bugs were found 22 million dollars had
already been spent on construction to
find the tiny transmitters embedded in
the Embassy's walls had not been easy
security experts from Washington were
sent to Moscow with special x-ray
equipment they were trained rock
climbers who had to hang off the side of
the building as they went from floor to
floor in weather that was sometimes 40
degrees below zero
the discovery of the bugs caused a great
uproar in Congress there were calls to
raise the entire structure and start
over with American construction workers
after years of debate it was finally
decided to demolish the top four floors
down to the sixth floor slab any
microphones below that level would not
matter because the plans called for the
construction of four new bug-proof
stories up to the tenth floor and a
penthouse any sensitive business would
be conducted in the new part the project
was called top hat the new floors were
built by 300 American construction
workers flown in for that purpose and
special precautions were taken to make
sure that this time there were no
transmitters no outsiders were allowed
on the construction site and security
was tight but an incident took place
that was not reassuring in April 1997 an
AWOL Russian soldier somehow managed to
slip into the residence of the Acting
American ambassador and spend the night
he was discovered the next day taking a
shower meanwhile US intelligence found
that the Soviets had also built tunnels
leading into and under the new American
Embassy in Moscow the way this was
learned was not publicized satellites
told us there were tunnels under the new
embassy one former intelligence official
revealed there were air pockets the heat
varies when there are tunnels and they
were detected Robert Hansen betrayed
monopolies in 1989 the FBI's tunnel was
compromised from that time forward
because the Russians did not occupy the
embassy until 1994 they had five years
to put countermeasures in place and to
build a secure room such as the bubble
in the US Embassy in Moscow for
sensitive conversations since the
Russians were aware of the tunnel it
produced little of value to the FBI in
the 1990s the bureau realized that the
tunnel was no longer useful its time had
passed
but when senior counterintelligence
officials met to consider the fate of
the tunnel a major argument broke out
the question said one former FBI
counterintelligence agent was should we
fill it up there was this big fight over
whether to fill it full of concrete John
Lewis for one argued against it what if
it turns out to be the same old Russia
Lewis asked suppose the Cold War comes
back the tunnel he argued might yet
prove useful in the future at the time
of course neither Lewis nor his
colleagues knew that Hanson had already
betrayed the tunnel finally an agreement
was reached the tunnel was sealed up at
the townhouse end where the tunnel began
but not filled since the FBI was no
longer using the facility it expected to
sell the house of course you'd want to
seal it up a former FBI man explained
how would you like to be the new owner
living in the house sitting down to
dinner and suddenly the Russians walk in
from the basement after Hanson was
arrested in 2001 the existence of the
tunnel and his betrayal of it became
known although the details of the
project remained highly classified when
the news of the tunnel broke the
Russians filed a diplomatic protest
calling it a flagrant case of the
violation of generally recognized
standards of international law Russia's
ambassador to Washington URI vo shakhov
seemed much more laid back if we find it
he told a reporter perhaps we can use it
as a sauna
