The analysts were confident  they had identified the mole at last.
"The stakes were high," King said. "We could not afford to be wrong. Our credibility for anything would be gone in the morning."
They would tell Division five the Intelligence Division at
headquarters but first they would need
to share their dramatic conclusion with
the Washington field office known inside
the FBI by its initials WFO the field
office was in charge of the hunt for the
mole protocol was to brief WFO first
King said and then division five the two
analysts met at WFO with Special Agent
Deborah Evans Smith who supervised the
mole hunt as head of the espionage squad
at WFO Smith had studied Russian
language and specialized in Russian
foreign intelligence cases first in Los
Angeles and then at WFO afterwards the
analysts returned to headquarters and
briefed Mike Rochford whose dogged
six-year pursuit of the mole had finally
succeeded despite the carping from many
of his colleagues who said he was
wasting the FBI's time and money he had
been turned down by 27 KGB officers who
spurned his million-dollar offer for
information leading to the identity of
the mole.
The 28th spy was Mr. Pym.
He knew the value of what he had he traded the file for: seven million dollars, and a guarantee of protection for himself and his family. 
The reputation of King and Millburn was still on the line, even after they unmasked Hanssen as the mole.
"We sent for Hanson's personnel file King
said in his application to the FBI we
found he had used Jack hot shower as a
reference any lingering private doubts
the analysts might have had were
dispelled by the personnel file on
November 22nd
Neil J Gallagher the FBI assistant
director for intelligence received his
first briefing on the contents of the
KGB file by that time the two analysts
had recognized Hanson's voice on the
tape but additional internal evidence in
the file made it plain that the mole was
Robert Hansen analysis of the file but
rest' that conclusion the moles first
letter to the KGB was dated October 1st
1985 and mailed from a Washington suburb
although Hansen was then assigned to New
York FBI records showed he was in
Washington on that day in May 1990 the
mole told the Russians that he would be
going on more trips that was the year
that Hansen traveled as an agent in the
Inspection Division including his jaunt
to Hong Kong with Priscilla Hsu Gailey
in November 1991 Hansen had been
promoted to unit chief at higher pay a
month later he told the KGB he had
received a salary increase and more
authority there were several references
to Chicago Hanson's birthplace now
Hansen was the FBI's target with a new
codename grade a Mr. Pim was safely in
the u.s. some members of his family had
also gotten out and the seven million
dollars was his to be paid over a period
of time checking the plastic bag for
fingerprints was not completed until
mid-december two latent fingerprints
were found on the bag they belonged to
Robert Phillip Hansen there had been
little question for several weeks that
the mole was indeed Robert Hansen but
now with the fingerprints the bureau had
solid forensic evidence it would have
been difficult for even the most skilled
defense lawyer to explain what Hansen's
prints were doing on a plastic bag
deposited in a secret file inside the
KGB in Moscow although the FBI had
followed a false trail for three years
because of Mike Rochford's persistence.
It had pulled off an unprecedented counterintelligence feat.
Nothing like it had ever happened before.
The Bureau had engineered Mr. Pym travel to New York, and had managed to pull off the seemingly impossible: to extract a file on the most damaging mole in the history of the FBI, from one of the most guarded buildings in Russia, the headquarters of the KGB's foreign intelligence service in Yasin.
