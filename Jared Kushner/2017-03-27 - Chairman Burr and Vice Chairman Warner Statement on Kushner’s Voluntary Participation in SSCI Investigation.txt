Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, today announced that Senior Advisor to the President Jared Kushner has voluntarily agreed to be interviewed as part of the Committee’s investigation into the Russian activities surrounding the 2016 election. Sens. Burr and Warner made the following statement on the announcement:

"From the beginning of this investigation we have committed to follow the facts wherever they lead us. This announcement serves to demonstrate that commitment.  Mr. Kushner will certainly not be the last person the committee calls to give testimony, but we expect him to be able to provide answers to key questions that have arisen in our inquiry. The timing of Mr. Kushner’s testimony is still being determined, but will only come after the committee determines that it has received any documents or information necessary to ensure that the meeting is productive for all sides."
