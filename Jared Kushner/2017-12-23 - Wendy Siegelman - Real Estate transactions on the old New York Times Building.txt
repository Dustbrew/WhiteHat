In 2015 Kushner Companies bought a stake in the old New York Times building from Soviet-born oligarch Lev Leviev who has close ties to Putin.
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Federal prosecutors in New York are looking at the loan made by Deutsche Bank to Jared Kushner’s real estate company a month prior to the 2016 election related to the deal with Leviev. The New York Times also reported on Friday about the subpoena issued out of the Eastern District of New York.
The Brooklyn U.S. attorney’s office sent a request mid-November to Kushner Companies for information related to a $285 million Deutsche Bank loan which was used to refinance the purchase of retail space at 229 West 43rd Street in the old New York Times Building.
Lev Leviev’s Africa Isreal Investments Ltd, known as AFI, purchased the property at 229 West 43rd Street in 2007, and has been covered in the news recently because of AFI’s involvement with the Prevezon money laundering case.
The Guardian reported on July 17th about Kushner’s real estate deal with Lev Leviev’s old New York Times building, and Leviev’s connection to the Prevezon money laundering case. Prevezon allegedly laundered money by purchasing real estate from Leviev’s company AFI in Europe and from AFI in New York City at 20 Pine Street. In addition the Daily Beast reported in November that Prevezon also bought a 30 percent stake in four Dutch AFI companies in 2008.
The news Friday about Federal prosecutors looking at the Deutsche Bank loan to Kushner Companies does not indicate any connection to the Prevezon money laundering case. However Kushner’s real estate deal with Leviev, who is connected to the Prevezon money laundering, case is intriguing, especially since Kushner also attended the July 9, 2016 meeting in Trump Tower with Natalia Veselnitskaya, the lawyer who represents Prevezon.
To help put the Deutsche Bank loan to Kushner into context, following is a timeline of some of the major real estate transactions related to the old New York Times building at 229 West 43rd Street.
