Dear Mr. Hauser:

The United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary has been investigating issues
relating to the Russian government’s disinformation efforts targeting the 2016 Presidential
election, as well as the nature of the FBI’s relationship with Christopher Steele. Part of that
inquiry involves examining the connections between those involved and Russian interests.

In light of this, by February 23, 2018, please answer the following questions:

1. Public reports and court documents indicate that you are an attorney for Mr. Oleg
Deripaska. Do you serve, or have you served, as legal counsel for Mr. Deripaska
or any business associated with him?

2. Have you ever hired or otherwise worked with Mr. Christopher Steele, Orbis
Business Intelligence Limited, Orbis Business International Limited, Walsingham
Training Limited, or Walsingham Partners Limited? If so, when, and what was
the nature of the arrangement?

3. Is it the case that Mr. Steele, through you, works or has worked on behalf of Mr.
Deripaska or businesses associated with him? If so, when has such work
occurred?

4. Are you otherwise aware of any business or financial relationships between Mr.
Steele and Russian government officials, Russian oligarchs, or Russian
businesses? 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Please contact Patrick Davis of my
staff at (202) 224-5225 if you have any questions.

Sincerely, 
Charles E. Grassley
Chairman
Committee on the Judiciary
United States Senate
