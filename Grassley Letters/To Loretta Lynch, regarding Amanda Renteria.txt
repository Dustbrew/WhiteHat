The Honorable Loretta E. Lynch
Dear Ms. Lynch,

On April 22, 2017, The New York Times reported that during the investigation of Russianhacking against political organizations in the United States, the FBI "received a batch of hackeddocuments" from U.S. intelligence agencies that had access to stolen materials stored on Russiannetworks.1 One of the documents provided to the FBI reportedly appeared to have implicationson the then-ongoing Clinton email investigation. Specifically, the FBI is reported to haveobtained an email or memo "written by a Democratic operative who expressed confidence thatMs. Lynch would keep the Clinton investigation from going too far."2 According to anonymousgovernment officials cited in the report, the discovery of the document "complicated" how FBIand the Justice Department would interact in the investigation because "[i]f Ms. Lynchannounced that the case was closed, and Russia leaked the document, Mr. Corney believed itwould raise doubts about the independence of the investigation."3 Similar concerns were raisedby Director Corney during this Committee's May 3, 2017 oversight hearing:

  The normal way to do it would be have the Department of Justice
  announce it, and I struggled, as we got closer to the end of it, with
  -- a number things had gone on, some of which I cannot talk about yet, 
  that made me worry that the Department leadershipcould not credibly 
  complete the investigation and declineprosecution without grievous 
  damage to the American people'sconfidence in the justice system. 
  
  And then the capper was -- and I am not picking on the Attorney
  General, Loretta Lynch, who I like very much. But her meeting with
  President Clinton on that airplane was the capper for me. And I then 
  said, you know what? The Department cannot by itself credibly end this.
  
On May 24, 2017, The Washington Post reported that in early March 2016 the FBI had received "what was described as a Russian intelligence document" that "cited a supposed emaildescribing how then-Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch had privately assured someone in theClinton campaign that the email investigation would not push too deeply into the matter."4 Morespecifically, the Russian intelligence document reportedly "referred to an email supposedlywritten by the then-chair of the Democratic National Committee, Rep. Debbie WassermanSchultz, and sent to Leonard Benardo, an official with the Open Society Foundations."5According to the article: "[i]n the supposed email, Wasserman Schultz claimed Lynch had beenin private communication with a senior Clinton campaign staffer named Amanda Renteria duringthe campaign. The document indicated Lynch had told Renteria that she would not let the FBIinvestigation into Clinton go too far...
