US Attorney Preet Bharara was at the Vanity Fair Oscars party Sunday night, after sending a message to Mayor de Blasio on Friday by using the same prosecutors who took down Sheldon Silver and Dean Skelos to interrogate him about his campaign fund-raising activities.
The legal eagle was at the dinner along with newly single Anne Wojcicki — who just split from ex-Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez — Katy Perry, Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg, director J.J. Abrams, Apple’s Jonathan Ive, Jimmy Iovine and Monica Lewinsky.
At the dinner in Beverly Hills, guests were greeted by 14 large-scale photographs of stars including David Bowie, Cate Blanchett and Jay Z.
