A high court judge gave Ablyazov a 22-month prison sentence for "deliberate" and "substantial contempts". The prosecution is understood to have asked the court to place a watch on airports after Ablyazov failed to appear.
BTA Bank first deputy chairman Nikolay Varenko said: "The sentences imposed by the judge reflect the very serious nature of Ablyazov's misconduct, as well as the lies told and documents forged to try to hide assets and dealings from the bank."
The contempts relate to the ongoing Â£3bn fraud case being brought against Ablyazov, a London resident.
BTA bank alleges Ablyazov misappropriated the funds while in charge of the Kazakhstan bank.
The court found Ablyazov had breached court orders relating to seizure of funds and disclosure of information. Mr Justice Teare said Ablyazov's conduct was "brazen" and said the sentence marked the seriousness of the contempt. He said: "I do not consider that anything less would mark the seriousness of Mr Ablyazov's conduct in failing to comply with the freezing order."
In previous related cases two other individuals Paul Kythreotis, a former business associate of Ablyazov and Syrym Shalabayev, brother-in-law and associate of Ablyazov, have been given prison sentences for contempt. A spokesman for Ablyazov said he would appeal.
Dan Hyde, a white collar fraud specialist at Cubism Law said: "That there are now three individuals guilty of contempt in this case arguably gives one cause to suspect a tangled web of intrigue and concealment calculated to hinder or prejudice the due administration of justice.
"One contempt is serious, three is a disobedient crowd."
