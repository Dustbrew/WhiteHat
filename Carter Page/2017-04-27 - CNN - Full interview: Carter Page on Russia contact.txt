ONE OF THE NAMES MENTIONED IN
ANY STORY IS CARTER PAIGE.
MR. PAIGE JOINS US NOW.
IT IS GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON "NEW
DAY."
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HIS AS
ASSE
ASSESSMENT?
>> IT IS A GLASS HALF FULL
PERSPECTIVE, CHRIS.
IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM THE
OPPOSITE VIEWPOINT, CONSIDER THE
COMPLETE LACK OF INFORMATION AND
THE COMPLETE LIES THAT HAVE BEEN
OUT THERE THROUGHOUT THE FIRST
100 DAYS OF THIS NEW
ADMINISTRATION ALL BASED ON
FALSE EVIDENCE, COMPLETE LIES
BACK TO THE DODGY DOSSIER.
>> YOU LIKE DODGY DOSSIER.
THAT'S A CATCH PHRASE OF YOURS.
YOU KNOW THE HISTORY HERE.
CNN TALKED ABOUT THE DISCLOSURE
OF THE DOSSIER, NOT THE CONTENTS
THEREOF.
BUT OVER TIME WE HAVE SEEN SOME
OF IT HAS NOT STOOD UP YET AND
OTHERS HAVE, SUCH THAT YOU WERE
A BENEFICIARY OF WHAT IS TRUE IN
THAT DOSSIER, ACCORDING TO A
FEDERAL JUDGE WHO FOUND IT AS
PROBABLY CAUSE TO HAVE YOU
SURVEILLED.
SO IT IS NOT COMPLETELY DODGEDY,
RIGHT?
>> EVERY WORD IN THERE ABOUT ME,
WHETHER IT'S ME ACTUALLY DEALING
WITH PAUL MANAFORT, SOMEONE WHO
I HAVE NEVER EVEN TALKED TO,
EVERY ALLEGATION IN THERE, ALL
THE PEOPLE I HAVE MET, EACH OF
WHICH ARE INDIVIDUALS I HAVE
NEVER SAID HELLO TO IN MY LIFE
IS A JOKE.
THE MAIN DIFFERENCE, THE TERM
DODGY DOSSIER COMES FROM 2003 IN
ANOTHER DOCUMENT FROM THE U. K.
THE DIFFERENCE HERE IT LED TO A
COMPLETE DISASTER
INTERNATIONALLY WITH THOUSANDS
OF AMERICAN LIVES LOST AND
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS WASTED.
>> RIGHT.
BUT WE HAVE ALREADY HAD OUR
DISASTER.
WE HAD RUSSIA INVOLVED IN OUR
ELECTION.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
FAR-REACHING EFFECTS MAY HAVE
BEEN.
AND YOU STILL HAVEN'T EXPLAINED
HOW A FEDERAL JUDGE COULD LOOK
AT SOME OF THIS INFORMATION
ABOUT YOU AND MAKE A CAUSE IN
REVIEWING THE EVIDENCE THAT
THERE WAS PROBABLE CAUSE TO
SURVEIL YOU.
THAT'S A FEDERAL COURT ASSESSING
EVIDENCE.
>> CHRIS, THERE IS NO PROBABLE
CAUSE.
THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY I
AM TAKING LEGAL ACTION NOW WITH
THE PRIVACY ACT OF 1974, LEGAL
ACTION WHICH I AM TAKING.
AND I VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO
GETTING DISCLOSURE ON THAT
WARRANT APPLICATION AND SEEING
WHAT EXACTLY WAS IN THERE
BECAUSE, AGAIN, THERE HAS BEEN
TERRIFIC REPORTING IN VARIOUS
NEWS OUTLETS, INCLUDING
WASHINGTON POST, NEW YORK TIMES
BASED ON VARIOUS LEAKS.
AND SOME OF THEM HAVE EXACTLY
POINTED BACK TO THAT DODGEDY
DOSSIER.
SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE
WHAT COMES OUT.
AGAIN, THERE IS NO PROBABLY
CAUSE AND THERE COULD BE NO
PROBABLE CAUSE BASED ON ANYTHING
I HAVE EVER DONE IN RUSSIA OR
WITH ANY RUSSIAN PERSON.
SO LET'S SEE WHAT COMES OUT.
>> I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME
WATCHING YOUR INTERVIEWS AND
SOMETIMES I SCRATCH MY HEAD AND
WONDER WHY YOU ARE DOING THEM.
YOU ARE VERY SLOW TO WANT TO
ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE
DETAILS OF YOUR AFFILIATION WITH
THE CAMPAIGN OR WHO YOU HAVE
TALKED TO IN RUSSIA AND ABOUT
WHAT.
WHAT IS YOUR MOTIVATION FOR
COMING ON OTHER THAN TO SAY
YOU'RE SUING?
YOU DON'T SEEM TO WANT TO GIVE
CLARITY TO THE ALLEGATIONS?
>> IT IS INTERESTING.
ONE OF THE PRIOR QUESTIONS --
THIS GOES BACK TO THE ISSUE OF
LEAKING, CHRIS, BECAUSE IN
SEVERAL OF THE PRIOR
DISCUSSIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH
ANDERSON COOPER AND OTHERS IS
THE CONSTANT QUESTIONS REGARDING
DID I EVER MEET THE AMBASSADOR.
AND I SAID A BRIEF HELLO TO HIM
IN CLEVELAND AND MAYBE A FEW
PASSING COMMENTS NEVER LASTING
MORE THAN A FEW SECONDS.
AND IT IS INTERESTING.
THE REASON WHY I WASN'T MORE
FORTHCOMING ABOUT THAT WITH
ANDERSON ABOUT A MONTH AND A
HALF AGO.
>> RIGHT.
>> IS I NEVER -- IT WAS A
CONFIDENTIAL MEETING.
EVERYONE THAT WAS IN THAT
MEETING AGREED THEY WOULD KEEP
THE CONVERSATION CONFIDENTIAL,
AND I WAS RESPECTING THAT.
SO THE REASON WHY I COULD TALK
ABOUT IT NOW IS THE KREMLIN
SPOKESPERSON HAS SAID THAT, YES,
THERE WERE DISCUSSIONS OR THERE
WERE VARIOUS INTERACTIONS
BETWEEN THE SUPPORTERS OF THE
TRUMP CAMPAIGN AS WELL AS THE
CLINTON CAMPAIGN, I WOULD
IMAGINE.
>> YOU KNOW HOW THAT PLAYS.
IT PLAYS AS YOU BEING DECEPTIVE
AND THERE IS A WHOLE LIST OF
THEM NOW STARTING FROM WHO
BROUGHT YOU INTO THE CAMPAIGN.
YOU WILL SAY I DON'T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT IT, I DON'T WANT TO
GET ANYBODY IN TROUBLE.
ISN'T THE TRUTH THAT REALLY
NOBODY BROUGHT YOU INTO THE
CAMPAIGN.
YOU APPROACHED THE CAMPAIGN AND
YOU THEN WERE LIGHTLY VETTED
WITH SOME OTHER PEOPLE.
YOU WERE INVITED TO A MEETING.
YOU WENT TO THAT MEETING, AND
THEN THE AFFILIATION KIND OF
FELL OFF.
ISN'T THAT A CLOSE RECKONING TO
HOW YOU GOT INTO THE CAMPAIGN
AND MAINTAINED CONTACT WITH SOME
OF THE MEMBERS?
>> AGAIN, CHRIS, I DON'T LIKE TO
DISCUSS CONFIDENTIAL DEALINGS.
>> THAT'S NOT CONFIDENTIAL.
>> I DON'T WANT TO CREATE ANY
ISSUES FOR PEOPLE.
AGAIN, THERE HAS BEEN SUCH A
COMPLETE FIRESTORM BASED ON THIS
COMPLETELY FALSE NARRATIVE.
>> BUT YOU HAVE TO DISRUPT THAT
NARRATIVE, CARTER.
I HAVE HEARD YOUR ANSWERS.
I HAVE STUDIED IT WELL.
I GET WHAT YOUR MOTIVATIONS ARE
IN TERMS OF LEAKING AND PRIVACY.
WHEN YOU DON'T GIVE ANSWERS TO
WHAT IS BOTHERING PEOPLE, YOU
JUST PRETEND AND THEN FUEL THAT
SPECULATION EVEN MORE.
YOU KNOW, ANOTHER ONE OF THEM ON
THIS IS THAT YOU GOT ASKED ABOUT
THIS IN A LARGER CONTEXT,
RUSSIA, WHAT THE INTELLIGENCE
COMMUNITY CAME TO AS A
CONCLUSION.
YOU SAY YOU DON'T BUY IT, THAT
YOU DON'T BUY THAT RUSSIA
INTERFERED WITH OUR HELPED MOT
WIKILEAK HACKS.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES, DONALD TRUMP, ACCEPTS
THAT AS REALITY NOW.
WHY DON'T YOU?
>> CHRIS, THE MAIN REASON IS THE
FACT THAT I HAVE BEEN THE VICTIM
OF ONE OF THE MOST HORRENDOUS
CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN
RECENT U.S. ELECTION HISTORY.
AND IT WAS INTERESTING WATCHING
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECH AT A
CHICAGO UNIVERSITY EARLIER THIS
WEEK WHERE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO GET MORE
INVOLVED IN THE POLITICAL
PROCESS.
NOT NECESSARILY BEING DIRECT
POLITICIANS AND ALL THE DIRTY
THINGS THAT GO ALONG WITH THAT,
BUT JUST AS PRIVATE CITIZENS,
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT I DID.
AND THE DISCLAIMER, WHICH SHOULD
HAVE BEEN ON THAT -- IN THAT
SPEECH THAT HE GAVE WAS, MAKE
SURE THAT YOU DON'T SAY ANYTHING
WHICH COULD BE CONSTRUED AS
QUESTIONING THE POWERS CURRENTLY
IN AUTHORITY BECAUSE THEN YOU'LL
HAVE A DOMESTIC POLITICAL
INTELLIGENCE OPERATION FOCUSED
ON YOU.
>> SO YOU THINK THAT BECAUSE YOU
SAY THINGS IN RUSSIA AND
ELSEWHERE THAT ARE NEGATIVE
ABOUT AMERICAN POLICY, THE
UNITED STATES INTEL SERVICES
DECIDED TO TAKE YOU DOWN AND
INVADED YOUR PRIVACY AND HURT
YOUR CIVIL RIGHTS IN THE
PROCESS?
IS THAT YOUR THEORY?
>> I'M BASING IT ON RECENT
REPORTS, CHRIS, WITH THE FACT
THAT THE MOST RECENT DOSSIER WAS
USED AS A FALSE BASIS SAYING
THERE IS PROBABLE CAUSE WHEN
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY ZERO.
>> REMEMBER, A FEDERAL JUDGE --
YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS A
POLITICAL THING, YOU CAN.
BUT A FEDERAL JUDGE LOOKED AT
THE EVIDENCE AND FOUND PROBABLE
CAUSE.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE FACTS, THEY
CERTAINLY LINE UP IN FAVOR OF
ASKING YOU SOME QUESTIONS.
2013 YOU WERE TALKING TO A GUY
WHO YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T KNOW WAS
A SPY, TURNED OUT TO BE A SPY.
NOW WE HAVE INDICATIONS THAT
THEY WERE WORKING YOU, WHETHER
YOU WERE AWARE OR NOT, TRYING TO
GET ACCESS TO THE CAMPAIGN.
THAT'S RELEVANT.
YOU THINK GO TO RUSSIA.
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THE
TRUMP CAMPAIGN ASKED YOU TO GO,
KNEW YOU WERE GOING, CONCERTED
ACTION WITH YOU IN GOING BECAUSE
YOU WON'T SAY SO.
IT FUELS SPECULATION ENOUGH SUCH
THAT THE DOJ WENT AND GOT A
WARRANT TO SURVEIL YOU.
>> CHRIS, I COULD TALK FOR HOURS
GOING THROUGH EACH OF THE
FALSEHOODS THAT WERE JUST
OUTLINED.
AND, AGAIN, YOU TALK ABOUT BEING
UNWITTING OR NOT REALLY
UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON.
I UNDERSTAND BASED ON ALL THE
FALSE EVIDENCE AND THE FALSE
NARRATIVE THAT'S BEEN OUT THERE.
THE REASON WHY THIS IS THE
CURRENT PUBLIC PERCEPTION, JUST
READ THAT BOOK "SHATTERED,"
ABOUT THE LOSING CAMPAIGN.
PAGE 395 TALKS ABOUT ALL THE
SPECIFICS.
AND THAT GIVES A LOT OF WHAT THE
MAJOR DRIVERS ARE.
>> BUT THERE IS NOTHING IN THERE
ABOUT TARGETING CARTER PAGE
UNFAIRLY.
EVERYTHING I SAID TO YOU IS A
FACT ABOUT WHO YOU TALKED TO AND
HOW THEY FOUND UP BEING RUSSIAN
OPERATIVES AND THEY SAY THEY
WERE TRYING TO WORK YOU.
THAT WAS A BASIS OF A LOT OF THE
SPECULATION.
WE STILL WIND UP IN THE SAME
PLACE, WHICH IS PEOPLE ARE
ASKING YOU THE SAME QUESTIONS
AND INSTEAD OF ANSWERING THE
QUESTIONS YOU TALK ABOUT BAD
MOTIVATIONS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU SAY THAT CLINTON IS COMING
AFTER YOU OR WAS COMING AFTER
YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE CATHOLIC AND
MALE.
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO
ANYBODY, DOES IT?
>> AGAIN, IF YOU -- NOT DIRECTLY
TARGETING ME, BUT, AGAIN, PAGE
395 OF "SHATTERED" TALKS ABOUT
TARGETING THE NEW
ADMINISTRATION.
AND, AGAIN, YOU ADD DAVID AND
OTHERS TALKING ABOUT POLLING
NUMBERS THIS MORNING AND WITHOUT
QUESTION THIS CLOUD, WHICH HAS
BEEN OUT THERE FOR MANY, MANY
MONTHS GOING BACK TO EVEN BEFORE
THE ELECTION, HAS BEEN A MAJOR
DRAG ON THE ADMINISTRATION.
AGAIN, BASED ENTIRELY ON LIES,
CHRIS.
>> SO IF PART OF YOUR INITIATIVE
IS TO BE FAIR TO THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN, THEN ANSWER SOME OF
THESE QUESTIONS.
DID YOU EVER WORK WITH FLYNN OR
KNOW HIM OR COMMUNICATE WITH HIM
ABOUT RUSSIAN POPOLICY.
>> NEVER.
I NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO
MEET HIM.
>> DID YOU EVER GIVE THE
PRESIDENT DIRECTLY ADVICE OR
GUIDANCE ABOUT RUSSIAN POLICY.
>> NEVER DIRECTLY, NO.
>> DID YOU EVER COORDINATE YOUR
TRIP TO RUSSIA WITH ANY MEMBER
OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, STAFF OR
ADMINISTRATION?
>> I WAS NOT REPRESENTING THE
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
I WAS THERE AS A PRIVATE
CITIZEN.
AGAIN, ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT
PRESIDENT OBAMA SUGGESTED, BEING
ACTIVE IN POLITICS OR IN
POLITICAL ISSUES, BUT I WAS NOT
REPRESENTING ANYONE OTHER THAN
MYSELF AND MY OWN PRIVATE VIEWS.
>> DID YOU COORDINATE OR
COMMUNICATE THE DETAILS OF YOUR
TRIP OR THAT YOU WERE GOING WITH
ANY MEMBER OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
OR ADMINISTRATION?
>> I NEVER -- AGAIN, NONE OF
THOSE DETAILS -- THEY KNEW I WAS
GOING, BUT NOTHING WAS --
>> HOW DID THEY KNOW?
>> I DON'T TALK ABOUT INTERNAL
DISCUSSIONS.
>> IT MATTERS BECAUSE THE
CUSHION IS THEY KNEW YOU WERE
GOING.
IF THEY KNEW YOU WERE GOING,
THEY HAD AN INTEREST IN YOU
GOING.
DID THEY COORDINATE ANYTHING YOU
SAID THERE WHICH WAS DESTRUCTIVE
TO AMERICAN POLICY?
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.
AND NOTHING I SAID WAS
DESTRUCTIVE TO AMERICAN POLICY,
CHRIS.
>> YOU READ ABOUT THE RUSSIAN
RECKONING THAT AMERICA HAS
CONDESCENDING AND ON THE WRONG
TRACK WITH WHERE RUSSIA IS
INVOLVED.
IT IS CRITICAL AND ATTACKING OF
THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY.
>> I THINK THAT'S AN
OVERSTATEMENT, CHRIS.
I ACTUALLY WAS FOCUSSING ON
MUTUAL RESPECT AND HOW A NEW
APPROACH IN FOREIGN POLICY COULD
HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE
FUTURE OF U.S.'S POSITION IN THE
WORLD.
THIS WAS A VERY PRO-AMERICAN
SPEECH HAVING A BETTER APPROACH.
>> THE LANGUAGE DOES NOT READ
PRO-RUSSIAN.
AND YOU KNOW THAT, NO MATTER
WHAT YOUR INTENTIONS MIGHT HAVE
BEEN.
YOUR BEING AN ADVISOR TO THE
PRESIDENT WAS A MAJOR FACTOR IN
THEM EXTENDING THE INVITATION.
ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT?
>> YOU ARE PROBABLY REFERRING TO
A COMMENT BY THE MEDIA PEOPLE AT
THE UNIVERSITY.
>> RIGHT.
>> AGAIN, I HAVE SPOKEN AT MAJOR
RUSSIAN UNIVERSITIES GOING BACK
OVER A DECADE ABOUT MY RESEARCH.
THERE IS NOTHING OUT OF THE
ORDINARY.
AND REALLY THE WHOLE MEDIA
FIRESTORM THAT HAS TRANSPIRED --
>> THE PERSON SAID IT FOR A
REASON.
WHAT I'M SAYING IS DO YOU THINK
IT IS NOT TRUE THAT THEY THOUGHT
YOU WERE A TRUMP ADVISOR AND
THAT WAS PART OF THE APPEAL IN
HAVING YOU COME TO THAT
PARTICULAR UNIVERSITY?
>> IT MAY HAVE BEEN PART OF THE
INTEREST.
BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW, IT IS
A --
>> BUT HERE'S WHY I'M ASKING.
IF YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS
WHAT THE MEDIA PERSON SAID AND
IT WAS PART OF THE INTEREST,
DIDN'T YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
TO SAY TO THEM, DON'T INVITE ME
TO THE UNIVERSITY IF YOU'RE
DOING IT BECAUSE I'M A TRUMP
ADVISOR BECAUSE I'M NOT.
I WAS AT ONE MEETING.
I SENT THEM SOME E-MAILS.
I DON'T HAVE ANY ACCESS TO THE
PRESIDENT.
I AM NOT A POLICY ADVISOR.
BUT YOU DIDN'T SAY ANY OF THOSE
THINGS.
>> ACTUALLY, NO, TO THE
CONTRARY.
I WAS VERY CLEAR ON MULTIPLE
OCCASIONS THAT, AGAIN, I AM JUST
THERE AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN AND
THIS IS NOT A MAJOR DRIVER AS TO
THE REASON WHY I AM THERE OR I'M
JUST TALKING ABOUT MY RESEARCH
AND THINGS I HAVE DONE OVER A
LONG TIME.
AND I THINK IN GENERAL LAST YEAR
THERE WAS AN INTEREST IN U.S.
PERSPECTIVES IN GENERAL AND
WHETHER ANY AFFILIATIONS I MAY
HAVE HAD ON THE SIDE JUST AS AN
INFORMAL UNPAID ADVISOR, WHICH I
MADE VERY CLEAR TO THEM
THROUGHOUT WAS NOT A FACTOR.
AND AGAIN IT IS A BIG
DISTRACTION FROM THE REAL CRIMES
AND THE REAL INFLUENCE ON THE
ELECTION, WHICH WAS THE CIVIL
RIGHTS VIATOLATIONS AND A LOT O
THE EXACT APPROACHES WITH THE
PROPAGANDA, WHICH WENT INTO
THIS.
AND NOT ONLY FEEDING FALSE
INFORMATION TO THE PRIVATE
MEDIA, MEDIA INSTITUTIONS LIKE
CNN, BUT EVEN GOVERNMENT
PROPAGANDA NETWORKS IN THE U.S.,
WHICH RECITED INFORMATION FROM
THE DODGEDY DOSSIER IN GOING
FROM SEPTEMBER TO NOVEMBER.
THIS IS $100 MILLION TAXPAYER
FUNDED INITIATIVE.
>> BUT REMEMBER THERE ARE
SOURCES WITHIN OUR INTELLIGENCE
AGENCIES THAT ARE LOOKING AT THE
INFORMATION IN THE DOSSIER AND
FOUND SOME OF IT TO BE CREDIBLE
AND RELIABLE.
YOU KNOW, AT THE END OF THE DAY, A LEAK IS
ONLY AS GOOD AS THE TRUTH OF WHAT
COMES OUT OF IT.
THAT IS WHAT'S GOING TO BE ASSESSED HERE.
CARTER PAGE, APPRECIATE YOUR SIDE
OF THE STORY.
THANKS, CHRIS.
