The initial intent for the release of these articles was a slow, weekly release of each article published under the John Galt pseudonym. 
John Galt was chosen because during the FBI’s Vault 7 investigation they labeled Mr. Schulte an extremist due to his libertarian blog from high school where he wrote about Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged, and opined the ideals of libertarianism; For these views a decade ago, the FBI and United States Government shamefully deemed him a threat, an extremist against the State.

The following are Schulte’s 10 articles written in December 2017 and only recently recovered and typed (older drafts were posted at one point but these are the final versions he always wanted to share. Note there may still be some copy mistakes).

1. Presumption of Innocence: A Petition for a Redress of Grievances
BANG! BANG! BANG!
I wake with a start. It’s still dark outside and my phone reads 5:30AM. 
BANG! BANG! BANG! I jump up and as I reach out for my door I hear it unlock, open, and immediately 10-12 men in bullet proof vests, carrying guns, and siege equipment burst into my apartment and throw me against the wall. 
“FREEZE!” they yell.
“Turn around and put your hands behind your back.” I obey every command.
They search my apartment hoping to find some contraband.
Eventually one of them grabs my clothes from the closet and tells me to get dressed.
I am not permitted to use my cell phone or do anything except dress. It’s a cold, crisp morning—no one around to witness the unusual scene taking place.
As I sit in the back of the car I wonder the true necessity of breaking into someone’s residence in the early morning with 10 armed agents who know full well that I am not a threat.
Once we reach our destination, the agents lead me around like a prized dog—they beam with pride at my enslavement.
I’m fingerprinted and my picture is taken several times throughout the morning, but eventually I’m turned over to the U.S. Marshalls at the courthouse. 
The Marshalls have a stricter protocol and in addition to the handcuffs affixed to a chain around my waist to keep my hands in front of me, my ankles are also uncomfortably cuffed as well. 
These ankle cuffs make it extremely difficult to walk forward, and so I do at a slow pace. 
I’m led to what looks like a holding area with several cells the size of a small room. 
The Marshalls remove my handcuffs, but leave the ankle shackles as they direct me into one of these cells with several other arrestees. 
There is no clock or any posted schedule so everyone just sits patiently waiting their turn.
Eventually it’s my turn and I’m led out before a magistrate judge.

2. Presumption of Innocence: A Loss of Citizenship
And so I am led back to the holding cell. 
We wait the remainder of the day until everyone has been to court. 
At the end of the night, the Marshalls herd us onto a bus and drive us from the courthouse to the detention center. 
On arrival, those of us who are new are separated so that we can complete the entry paperwork and processing and change from our street clothes to the standard prison-issue uniform. 
People are generally cordial as they reunite with old prison friends or family members who have always been in the system. 
The best advice people give is that your public “pretender” will not work on your case nor do anything on your behalf unless you specifically tell them to do so: 
You’re on your own. 
The prison eventually feeds us for the first time with sandwiches as we finalize processing. 
In addition to the uniform, you are given bedsheets (no pillow), a cup, a spork (you only get one so don’t lose it!), a toothbrush and toothpaste, a bar of soap, a towel, and a roll of toilet paper. 
Everyone enters the prison onto the temporary holding floor—one of several 120-man blocks. 
On our way up, the guard leaves us in the elevator for several minutes and two of the other inmates joke about taking off, but remind each other that it’s definitely a violation. 
I sometimes marvel at the economic ingenuity and sociological principles that dictate behavior here.
The prison monetary system is built on food from the commissary (foods and snacks that can be purchased weekly) and certain non-perishable food items that retain their intrinsic value. 
People hustle their prison trades as tailors, cooks, manufacturers of certain items, drug trade, etc. 
The biggest prison faux pas is to call someone a “bitch” or for you to “punk” someone to make them appear like a bitch. 
This will almost always lead to a confrontation if not a straight fight. 
Alphas sometimes probe for weakness, and if you don’t stand-up for yourself then that may well lead to incessant bullying where you lose food or other possessions or privileges. 
Keep in mind that many people here are convicted murderers, rapists, or potentially anything. 
Some are even facing life sentences (“lifers”) with literally nothing to lose. 
Oh, right—they won’t ask you until a month after your processing, once you sit down with the unit team, but you are actually given the option to either be put here in general population with convicted people and people accused of any crime (they make no distinction nor do they separate violent offenders) or the hole—AKA solitary confinement. 
Your choice, though. 
Another big rule to protect yourself in federal prison is to never discuss your case with anyone. 
Any detail you give people and they can and will jump on your case. 
People are vultures and will do anything to help their own situation. 
You give detail, they go to your prosecutor, give minor details you told them in combination with invented details, and now their sentencmg is reduced and you gain a conspiracy charge or a confidential informant against you on your case. 
The federal prosecutors know this happens, and that most of the time the information is bogus, but they eat it up anyway.
Anyway, we finally get settled into our cells and meet our assigned cellmate (“celly”). 
They segregate the 2-bunk cells by race. Hopefully, your celly isn’t violent, psychotic, dealing drugs, or in possession of a knife or anything. 
He is. 
Hopefully, he doesn’t get caught because ultimately, you are held responsible for what may be found in his locker or even his actions. 
As we settle in, we are given half a mattress and no pillow, enjoy! 
Pillows are actually considered contraband and are banned. 
The mattresses are either cut in half due to lack of resources or used by the inmates to make illegal pillows. 
Oh, right, speaking of a lack of resources—if you don’t have a commissary account or can’t hustle a jailhouse trade then you will likely go hungry.
You will have to rush to be at the front of the chow line, then get in the seconds line while you scarf down your meal standing up and pray there is extra, because the prison food is not only unpleasant but incredibly meager such that everyone typically pays extra for food from the commissary. 
Ah, I finally meet my new celly. 
He’s in for bank robbery. 
He’s a nice guy who’s on medication for a mental illness and is partially deaf and disabled. 
He admits to the crime as many do, but also similarly states he did it simply to get sent back to prison. 
He was starving, living on the streets with no government assistance. 
He had to make the choice to either die in the streets or commit a crime; no, not a choice as there really is no decision to be made. 
He is simply one of the many that society has completely failed. 
It was in this moment that I almost cried for the first time in prison. 
I truly, deeply felt so bad for him and the others as I looked around. 
Most were uneducated who have known nothing else than a life of crime and prison since childhood. 
What kind of life is this? 
I had been extraordinarily lucky to be born into privilege. 
I was lucky to possess the intelligence, communication skills, and determination that many here were lacking. 
The government preys upon the poor and the weak. 
It was in this moment that I realized I could not let this continue. 
I felt an incredible wave of emotion as I had an epiphany—this is my true calling in life. 
This is what I was sent here to do. 
I will bring this “justice” system crumbling to its knees.

3. Presumption of Innocence: Do You Want to Play a Game?
[Skip]

4. Presumption of Innocence: Detention is Not Punishment
Prison is not exciting.
Most people have no concept of prison.
Up until my first arrest I also had no real concept of prison or the justice system.
My motivation for writing this redress of grievances is to present the information to you, to hopefully change minds, and ultimately ignite a civil rights movement to restore these civil liberties that Congress and the courts have pilfered; we have been blind and content as our rights have eroded. 
I will step up and demand change.
I will fight for the poor and uneducated who have been nameless, forgotten victims to the system for generations. 
Will you stand by my side?
The federal detention center is the worst kind of psychological warfare imaginable. 
The immediate and most noticeable equivalents are in the architecture and the little things, the sum of which have huge effects on the psyche. 
For example, the paint everywhere is a deep, melancholy gray. 
Even the regular tiled floors are painted gray to give a poor, somber mood—why else paint the tiled floors of every cell? 
Pillows and all conveniences that we normally take for granted are banned.
They take everything from you but your spirit, attitude, and sheer will to survive. 
The facility itself is positioned such that no sunlight ever enters through the small, barred windows. 
These windows offer tantalizing views of civilization that people look out longingly. 
The cells are dimly lit and the barren, cinder block walls and open piping are so aesthetically unpleasant that it feels as if the building is unfinished. 
It’s evident that at a minimum psychologists were consulted in the design and planning for detention centers. 
What’s more is once convicted you can become a “cadre” in the same prison and are moved to another unit where you gain rights, privileges, and amenities such as increased visit time, recreational time, the ability to travel outside of prison, TVs in cells, etc. 
Anyway, our cages are 44 ft2 bathrooms for two people and consist of metal bunk beds, a metal desk and slide-out stool, lockers, toilet, sink, plastic mirror, and a small window. 
The toilets and sinks are frequently broken, partially functional, and leaky. 
The cot “mattresses” are small and frequently cut in half—we are given a single bed sheet and blanket as they blast the AC and you shiver and freeze all night long or they blast the heat and you endure unbearable heat and humidity as you lay on your cot in your underwear sweating all night long. 
Seriously, there is no in-between, no therrnostat or temperature control—it’s either torture by extreme cold or extreme heat. 
The bunk beds have no ladder to reach the top bunk and the bunks themselves are just hard metal that you can feel through the thin cots. 
There is no cleaning supplies for the cells and you must purchase your own soap and toilet paper so most people rarely or never clean their cells. 
The electrical wiring is faulty and the lights periodically go out completely. 
The few showers for the unit are all broken with no shower heads, visible black mold, and bacteria you can practically see—if you don’t purchase shower shoes you will definitely contract MRSA or some other skin-eating bacteria or disease. 
Prison is absolutely crawling with bacteria especially staphylococcus and other infectious diseases due to its disgusting state so you need to be on your A-game with hygiene: Wash your hands frequently, buy extra soap, and never touch your face. 
If you can only afford a few items from commissary then you absolutely should purchase shower shoes and soap above all else. 
Ineffective ventilation causes unsafe, contaminated air. 
In fact if your unit is lucky enough to have a washer and dryer, the dryer vents the lent and everything out into the open unit—the air is teeming with debris and particles.
When fights break out, it snows and there’s low staff, the staff have a party, or for any reason whatsoever they can institute 24-hour lockdown. 
Usually, we are just locked in our cages between 9PM-6:30AM, 3:30PM-5PM, and an additional lockdown between 9:30AM-11AM on weekends for a total of 11 hours during the week and 12 and a half on weekends. 
However, in the commonplace occurrence of a 24-hour lockdown, we’re in the cages for, you guessed it, 24 hours. 
No attorney visits, phone calls, or anything allowed during this time. 
We’re served frozen solid, expired food. 
Normally, the food is bad enough: meager portions of high-sodium, low quality, disgusting food that would be illegal to feed to your dog.
Truly, you have never tasted such sub-standard, barely edible “food”— Half the time it’s either over-cooked or still raw because like everything else in prison it’s run by the inmates. 
If you actually expect to survive you need to purchase your own food and highly-processed, unhealthy snacks from commissary. 
The orderlies, those inmates who work in each unit, are tasked with everything at the prison—cleaning, cooking, assisting counselors, etc. 
There is only one corrections officer per unit of—100-120 inmates.
Most places don’t have recreational rooms so they’ll schedule outside recreational time—but it’s 50-50 whether you actually go or not. 
Supposedly, you get three rec times per week at one hour each for a total of 3 hours of fresh air and exercise per week. 
AT MAX. 
Realistically, we end up going once per week and if it snows or is too cold—Zero. 
Zero exercise for weeks. We are caged and treated worse than regulations outline for the treatment of animals; we’d be better off on display at a zoo. 
When we’re not locked in our cages or allowed to have fresh air we can sit out in the common area so long as you are wearing the full prison uniform—the dirt brown onesie—colloquially known as the “fart suit”. 
If you aren’t weanng the uniform expect to receive a ticket or be thrown into solitary confinement.
The common area has 4 TVs that arc split between Telemundo, BET, VH1, and somctimes ESPN or E! 
That’s pretty much it—Spanish or “Love and Hip-hop”. 
The TVs have no sound as you are required to purchase a $7 radio for $50 or a $20 mp3 player for $100 at commissary and tune to a specific FM frequency to listen to the channel. 
Aside from watching TV, you can gamble in dice games, dominos, or cards—but be very careful because most people are stabbed and die from gambling; they either owe someone money or win someone’s money who doesn’t want to part with it. 
Thus, I don’t recommend gambling unless you’re prepared to fight.
Aside from the overpriced commissary that the Bureau of Prisons profits, they also provide two other monopolized, overpriced services: You are allowed 5 hours of phone usage per month in 15-minute intervals per hour—That’s 20 15-minute phone calls per month. 
That’s it. 
The phone calls are charged excessively as a single 15-minute session will cost you $3.15.
That’s $63 per month for the full 20 phone calls which was more expensive than my unlimited plan that included unlimited calling, texting, and a data plan all for $45. 
It’s extraordinary that they can do this—we literally have no choice and must pay whatever outrageous price they charge. 
They also offer TRULINKS email which is basic text-based email that inmates can send and receive with approved individuals. 
Each email is carefully scrutinized and delayed in both directions. 
Here, you are charged 5 cents per minute. 
You type an email, read an email, scroll through your inbox and 15 minutes later you’ve spent 75 cents. 
That doesn’t sound like a lot, but if you spend a conservative 30 minutes per day reading and writing emails then by the end of the month that’s $45. 
So, you’re nickel-and-dimed well over $100 per month and that’s before you even purchase any food that you need to survive or the toilet paper, soap, and other life necessities. 
It’s inconceivable that the government can accuse people of a crime, kidnap them from their homes, cage them, and then force them to pay for services where they’re the only provider. 
Not only that, but they RECORD every single call and email you write and receive. 
That’s right, even if you’re speaking to your lawyer that call and email can be used against you in the court of law so use their overpriced services with caution—Anything about your case and you can be sure they enter it into evidence at your next court appearance. 
People have been recorded admitting guilt with their attorneys or friends, discussing current and future crimes, and even directly buying or selling drugs. 
Starting to understand why prosecutors love pretrial detention so much? 
They control everything and the longer you’re here the more likely you slip up and say something or write something incriminating or even tell the wrong person some detail about your case—The longer you’re detained the probability of losing your case approaches one just as this corrupt system is designed; you have no chance. 
Oh did you want a privileged call with your lawyer? 
Sure, you can request it but it will never be approved.
The “staff” supposedly here for your benefit are literally never here. 
Are they simply overworked and assigned to every unit or are they just at home committing timecard fraud? 
Who knows? 
The end result is that no one is ever here to assist you if you need anything like a privileged phone call—you just have to wait until your attorney comes to visit you. 
Speaking of the “staff’, when they actually are here they are an incompetent, bureaucratic nightmare as you would expect from a government employee.
They will never help you even if they are here—Ask them to do something and they Instantly become agitated and complain about having to work all the time. 
Oh and the bureaucracy—I had family fill out visit forms and bring them to the prison to submit them, but the prison refused to accept them. 
You see, they must be mailed. 
They’ll come through the mail to the prison, but they can’t accept them at the prison so my family had to go back home and actually mail the forms. 
Unfortunately, they mailed them directly to me at the prison instead of to the counselor.
I tried to take them to her, but nope!
That’s not the right process. 
I had to mail the forms back and ask my family to mail them back to the prison, but send them to the counselor instead of me. 
The entire Bureau of Prisons management up to the top are just as uneducated and incapable. 
We had a scheduled prison inspection by the regional directors. 
Did they talk to the prisoners or tell us when the broken microwaves, ice machines, and hot water machine would be fixed? 
Did they inspect the cleanliness or review their own process for improvement? 
Did they scrutinize officer treatment of the prisoners? 
LOL. 
No, they forced the prisoners to repaint everything gray and checked to ensure that 
1.) Beds were made to their Nazi satisfaction; 
2.) Nothing was blocking the torture vents they used to blast us each night with extreme hot or cold; 
3.) That only 5 books were on top of the lockers and not a single book over 5; 
4.) No pictures of family or decorations of any kind were in the cell to make the torture chamber feel more like home. 
That’s it—just ensuring the torture was going on schedule. 
No updates on our rat infestation. 
In fact they refused to engage with any inmates at all. 
This was the yearly B.O.P. inspection. 
The disgusting living area, black mold, broken appliances, and non-existent counselors and unit manager were deemed in accordance with B.O.P. guidelines. 
It’s incredible.
The cadres here have more privileges than you but they are here to be punished by society. 
The corrections officers tell you that you are here to be punished. 
Yet, the courts say you are not? 
There are no first amendment rights—You can’t say or write anything without their approval; there is no freedom of speech. 
Religious services must come to you or else you don’t get to use the shared religious service hall for prayer. 
If the Catholic diocese does not send a priest then you cannot attend Catholic mass even though there is a church across the street; there is no freedom of religion. 
What about the 2nd amendment? 
LOL. 
4th? 
Your room and locker are frequently searched and your property seized at any time for any reason. 
5th? 
All your communication is monitored and everything you say will be used against you. 
6th? 
8th? 
All denied. 
The Feds even use your kids and family against you. 
When your visitors are actually approved 3 months later then you get visitation once per week for 1 hour and a maximum of 3 people. 
You are brought into a room where you are shoulder-to-shoulder with other inmates and across from your visitor. 
There is no privacy, no room, and no physical contact permitted which they vigorously enforce.
There’s no modern technology whatsoever. 
We wash our clothes by hand in the sinks or moldy showers, we use typewriters (which the BOP are likely the only remaining customers) that the BOP purchase for us to use for official correspondence with the court since computers and internet are unequivocally banned. 
There are no microwaves, ovens, ice machines, pillows, etc. 
There is no health care, dental care, or first aid. 
No hydrogen peroxide, no bandages, and no way to dress wounds or obtain medicine if sick; all we can do is what they did in the 1800s—pray. 
I was previously seeing a cardiologist for a preexisting heart defect, but I’ve been denied access to a cardiologist and my treatment has been put on-hold. 
They adjusted my medication because they did not want to pay for the drugs I needed. 
If you get sick then you’re on your own—buy soups and tea and hope your body fights it off quickly. 
If you get an open wound here, it is bound to get infected. 
Find toilet paper and use soap to keep the wound from festering—good luck. 
The Feds can do anything they want and face no repercussions. 
Finally, the worst part, legally, is the inability to meaningfully contribute to your own defense from prison—Exactly what the feds want. 
They don’t want you to challenge them. 
You are forced to use dictionaries, thesauruses, encyclopedias, and old law books. 
Sure, this was effective back in 1922, but it’s 2017. 
This is absolutely absurd and entirely unconstitutional. 
How do you take the most important and powerful resource, the internet, and deny it to the very people who actually need it most?
How could I ever find that 2016 study by Dobbiey, Goldinz, and Yang without the internet? 
How could I ever hope to find important research and case law analysis without the internet? 
I’m flying blind and denied a co-pilot. 
How could I ever hope to effectively, efficiently, and fairly fight my case when I am not permitted to participate? 
The resources of the federal government are phenomenal—on each case they have 3-5 attorneys, 10 FBI agents, an entire technical support team back at Quantico, and these are just the official contributors that I see; yet, I can’t even use the internet? 
Truly, this corrupt game is stacked substantially in their favor. 
The ease of using Google to search and instantly find relevant information in lieu of reading 10 books to find an inferior subset of the information is unmatched. 
Thus, the United States federal government denies you this vital resource.

5. Presumption of Innocence: Guilty Until Proven Wealthy
If you are rich then you can afford the top-notch O.J. representation. 
If not then you must search for an attorney to represent you. 
Oh, are you detained pretrial? 
Good luck. 
You can’t use the not even a monitored version to research lawyers for your case. 
The internet is the most vital resource available to you so of course they deny it. 
They don’t want to give you any chance to succeed—they block you at each and every possible step. 
If you can’t afford an attorney then you don’t get a choice— the court randomly assigns a CJA or a public defender to your case. 
These people can be hit-or-miss, but the private attorneys appointed by the courts are the absolute worse. 
These are people trying to make it in private practice, but are failing; they are literally the bottom of the barrel of attorneys who can’t trick anyone to pay them so they must rely on the courts to find them clients. 
While their peers and successful lawyers can get their own clients and earn $250, $500, $1000+ per hour, these court-appointed attorneys can only earn ~$150 at most per hour with a cap of $10,000 per case. 
Thus, they need to accept tons of cases to pay the bills.
But not just accept tons of clients—quickly resolve each and every case too. 
As you can see, the incentive here is to accept the most cases as possible and work the least amount possible then claim their $10,000 and move on to the next victim. 
These lawyers hate clients who want to go to trial more than the federal prosecutor and will actively work against the interests of their own clients to deliver them right to the prosecutor.
Why waste the time and effort with a single client when you can finish 15 cases in the same time? 
There is no real time to get to know you as a person or interpersonal time.
They don’t visit you. 
They don’t email you. 
They don’t work on your case or file motions unless you request them to do so.
Honestly, you’re better off working on your own case in lieu of a court-appointed lawyer especially considering the time and effort put forth—They only “negotiate” your prison sentence. 
They work with the prosecutor and agree to terms across different cases! 
That’s right—your plea may have been used for another client to plea to a lower charge or a lesser sentence. 
At the end of the day it’s all about the plea deal.
Federal public defenders are less of a death sentence than court-appointed lawyers, but it depends who you get. 
If you’re lucky you’ll find an attorney who took the job for public service and actually wants to help people. 
Just kidding, that would be a unicorn. 
Public defenders are overworked and take on many cases so they have much less time to designate to each client. 
However, unlike court-appointed attorneys they are paid on salary and have much less financial incentive to minimize time and performance on each client. 
But once again, the name of the game is the plea deal.
And so this is how every federal case goes: Arrest and arraignment. 
Lawyer assigned. 
You sit in prison for 2 months while nothing happens. 
Then there’s court where both sides briefly discuss discovery. 
Another 2 months pass, You’re ready to get out of the God-forsaken hellhole that is pretrial detention at almost any cost. 
If you are one of a few to have no co-defendants on your case then your lawyer will finally come to see you and bring you the plea deal from the prosecutor (No, your lawyer didn’t negotiate anything). 
If you have many co-defendants then they’ll keep everyone in prison a full year to try to get people to rat and turn on each other before they bring you a plea deal.
The deal you are offered is a dummy deal.
What is this “dummy plea deal”?
It simply states your charges and your guidelines and asks you to plead guilty and avoid trial in exchange for an official bribe of a 3- point deduction called “Acceptance of Responsibility”.
Yup, there is an official bribe in all these coercive plea deals that offer you a 2-3 point deduction in your guidelines for pleading guilty.
The people who suffer the most from the prison industrial complex and the incentive to incarcerate are the children and future generations. 
It’s a vicious cycle that holds the poor in a persistent state of poverty and crime. 
These children are not given equal opportunity—They begun life with a substantial roadblock that is all but impossible to overcome. 
Poverty begets crime begets poverty begets crime. 
Now compare this childhood with my own-Middle class with both parents who come from strong religious and family backgrounds. 
I grew up with heavy Importance and encouragement for education. My likes and interests were kindled. 
I was involved in every extracurricular from cub scouts to sports to band, theater, technology clubs, and college prep groups. 
My family was not wealthy, but I had the richest childhood and every opportunity for success. 
So, while my family was supporting me at basketball games and band concerts the kid born into poverty with a father in prison was already working a job or selling drugs to support his family.
