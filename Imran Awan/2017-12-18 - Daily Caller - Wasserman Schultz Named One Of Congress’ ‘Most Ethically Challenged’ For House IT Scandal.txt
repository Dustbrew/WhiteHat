Independent government watchdog Foundation for Accountability & Civic Trust (FACT) named Democratic Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz one of Congress’ “most ethically challenged” members for her role in the House IT scandal.
Wasserman Schultz was named the second most ethically challenged member; every congressman on Congress’ list of secret harassment settlements tied for first. 
Two of Wasserman Schultz’s former IT aides, Imran Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, have been indicted on charges of conspiracy against the United States. Evidence gathered in a cybersecurity probe in the House of Representatives revealed a litany of violations, although the two aides have not yet been charged in that probe.
FACT filed a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics in July after Wasserman Schultz continued employing Awan for months after Capitol Police said he was under investigation, and even after he was banned from the House network. Wasserman Schultz seemingly planned to continue paying Awan even after he moved back to his native country of Pakistan.
The Democratic congresswoman also tried to intimidate Capitol Police into handing over a laptop that she indicated belonged to her. She later changed her story and said the laptop belonged to Awan. The laptop’s hard drive has played a central role in the legal case against the former Democratic IT aides.
Republican Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis said in August that the House IT scandal, which remains ongoing, is “one of the all-time congressional scandals in the last 30 years.”
