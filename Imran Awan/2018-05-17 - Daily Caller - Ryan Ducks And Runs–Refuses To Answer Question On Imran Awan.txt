Speaker of the House Paul Ryan refused to answer a question about Imran Awan — who President Donald Trump dubbed as the “Pakistani Mystery Man” — when asked in a press conference Thursday.
When The Daily Caller News Foundation’s Luke Rosiak asked why Awan has not been arrested for what a House Inspector General investigation called “unauthorized access” to congressional servers, Ryan, acknowledged he knew about Awan, but said he would not comment on an ongoing investigation.
“Well this is an ongoing police investigation so I don’t want to get into the details of a police investigation,” Ryan said.
Awan worked as Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s IT aide and had access to nearly every file of 1 in 5 House Democrats.
Ryan has previously said he is aware of the Awan investigation and said the U.S. Capitol Police are getting “the kind of help they need from other sources” in their criminal investigation, but no new information has been made public.
