I will be out of town next week, and so wanted to provide you my initial thoughts. 

• The piece is superb. 

• If anything, the Director may wish to add a sentence or two in his conclusion about the FBI's obligations 
more generally. In other words, something not specifically about this case, but about what the FBI aims 
to do in all of our cases. He could do this after the first sentence in his last paragraph. For example, 
something like: 

'The American people entrust the FBI with impartially investigating all matters of crime involving people 
from all walks of life. We take that obligation extremely seriously, and" I can assure you that this 
investigation was done competently, honestly, and independently. No outside influence of any 
kind was brought to bear. I know there were many opinions expressed by people who were not 
part of the investigation — including people in government - but none of that mattered to us. 
Opinions are irrelevant, and they were all uninformed by insight into our investigation, because 
we did the investigation in a professional way. Only facts matter, and the FBI found them here 
in an entirely apolitical and professional way. I couldn't be prouder to be part of this 
organization. 

I suggest this only to emphasize the point that this investigation was conducted in a manner consistent 


SJC000028 











with the fairness aims of all of our investigations, (i.e., no one is above the law, etc.). 

• The piece contains information that indicates the Secretary did not meet federal record requirements. 
Before deciding on the final wording of such information, the Director may wish to have someone study 
the impact his statements could have on any/all administrative inquiries relative to federal record 
obligations. I suggest this only so he's aware of any potential fallout in that regard. I assume such 
administrative inquiries aren't really a big deal, but if I was him I'd just want to be certain before 
deciding on the final wording. 

• I saw two typos on page 4, which I highlighted in red and yellow. 

Thank you for sharing the below with me.

Folks: 

The Director composed the below straw man in an effort to compose what a "final" statement might look like in 
the context of a press conference. This was really more of an exercise for him to get his thoughts on the matter 
in order, and not any kind of decision about venue, strategy, product, etc. 

The Director asked me to share this with you four, but not any further . The only additional people who have 
seen this draft are Jim Rybicki and Jim Baker. Please do not disseminate or discuss any further. 

I do not know if the boss will want to discuss this at the Monday update but please review it before the meeting 
just in case.

I’ve been trying to imagine what it would look like if I decided to do an FBI 
only press event to close out our work and hand the matter to DOJ. To help 
shape our discussions of whether that, or something different, makes sense, I 
have spent some time crafting what I would say, which follows. In my 
imagination, I don’t see me taking any questions. Here is what it might look 
like: 


Good afternoon folks. I am here to give you an update on our investigation of 
Secretary Clinton’s use of a private email system, which began in late August mid- 
Julv . 

After a tremendous amount of work, the FBI has completed its investigation and 
has referred the case to the Department of Justice for a prosecutive decision. What 
I would like to do today is tell you three things: (1) what we did; (2) what we 
found; (3) what we have recommended to DOJ. 

But I want to start by thanking the many agents, analysts, technologists, and other 
FBI employees who did work of extraordinary quality in this case. Once you have 
a better sense of how much we have done, you will understand why I am so 
grateful and proud of their efforts. 


So, first: what we have done over the last eight months. 


The investigation began as a referral from the Intelligence Community Inspector 
General in connection with Secretary Clinton’s use of a ^rivate[email server during 
her time as Secretary of State, focused on whether classified information was 
transmitted on that private system. 

Our investigation focused on whether there is evidence that classified information 
was improperly stored or transmitted on that private system, in violation of a 
federal statute that makes it a felony to mishandle classified information either 
intentionally or in a grossly negligent way, or a second statute that makes it a 
misdemeanor to knowingly remove classified information from appropriate 
systems or storage facilities. 


Commented [pi]: Consider whether it is more appropriate to 
call this a "personal" or "privately-owned" email server. "Private" 
may denote a commercial email service, such as gmail or hotmail. 
Use of these private commercial services was widespread at State 
before and during her tenure. 


Consistent with our counterintelligence responsibilities, we have also investigated 
to determine whether there is evidence of computer intrusion in connection with 


SJC000031 









the private email server by any foreign power, or hackers on behalf of a foreign 
power. 


I have so far used the singular term, “email server,” in describing the referral that 
began our investigation. It turns out to have been more complicated than that. 
Secretary Clinton used several different servers and providers administrators of 
those servers during her four years at the State Department, and used numerous 
mobile devices to view and send email on that private domain. As new server s and 
equipment s and providers were employed, older servers were taken out of service, 
stored, and decommissioned in various ways. Piecing all of that back together to 
gain as full an understanding as possible of the ways in which private email was 
used for government work has been a painstaking undertaking, requiring thousands 
of hours of effort. 


For example, when one of Secretary Clinton’s original private servers was 
decommissioned in 2013xx, the email software was removed. Doing that didn’t 
remove the email content, but it was like removing the frame from a huge finished 
jigsaw puzzle and dumping the pieces on the floor. The effect was that millions of 
email fragments end up unsorted in the server’s un-used - or “slack” — space. We 
searched went through all of it to see what was there, and what parts of the puzzle 
could be put back together. 

FBI investigators have also read all 34,000 of the approximately 30,000 emails 
provided by Secretary Clinton to the State Department in spring 2015 December 
2014 . Where an email was assessed as possibly containing classified information, 
the FBI referred the email to ^fre- any U.S. government agency that was the-aTikely | 
“owner” of the information in the email so that agency could make a determination 
as to whether the email contained classified information at the time it was sent or 
received, or whether there was reason to classify the email now, even if its content 
was not classified at the time it was sent (this is the process sometimes referred to 
as “up classifying”). 

From that group of 34,000 30,000 emails that had been returned to the State 
Department in late 2014#, the FBI sent xxxx emails to agencies for classification 
determinations. Of those, xxxx have been determined by the owning agency to 
contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Xxxx of 
those contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; xxxx 
contained Secret information at the time; and xxxx contained Confidential 
information. Separate from those, a total of xxxx additional emails were “up

Commented [p4]: Ultimately, the number of emails determined 
to be classified will be a small percentage of those sent for review.

took an overly expansive and generous position in deciding what to 
send out for review. 


SJC000032 




























classified” to make them Secret or Confidential; the information in those had not 
been classified at the time the emails were sent. 

The FBI also discovered xxxx- several thousand work-related emails that were not 
in the group of 31.000 30.000 that were returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 
2014#. We found those additional emails in a variety of ways. Some had been 
deleted over the years and we found traces of them on devices that supported or 
were connected to the private email domain. Others we found by reviewing the 
archived government email accounts of people who had been government 
employees at the same time as Secretary Clinton, including high-ranking officials 
at other agencies, with whom a Secretary of State might naturally correspond. This 
helped us recover work-related emails that were not among the 34,000 30,000 
produced to State. Still others we recovered from the laborious review of the 
millions of email fragments dumped into the slack space of the server 
decommissioned in 2013xx. 

All told, we found xxx^ thousands of emails that were not among those produced 
to the State Department last year in late 2014 . Of those, we assessed that xxxx 
possibly contained classified information at the time they were sent or received and 

so we sent them to other government agencies for classification determinations. 

To date, agencies have concluded that xxxx of those were classified at the time 
they were sent or received, xxx at the Secret level and xxxx at the Confidential 
level. There were no additional Top Secret emails found. Finally, xxxx none of 
those we found have since been “up classified.” 

I should add here that we found no evidence that any of the additional work-related 
emails we found were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them. Our 
assessment is that, like many users of private email accounts, Secretary Clinton 
periodically deleted emails or emails were purged from the system when devices 
were changed. Because she was not using a government account, there was no 
archiving of her emails, so it is not surprising that we discovered emails that were 
not on Secretary Clinton’s system in 201 #4, when she produced the 34,000 30,000 
emails to the State Department. 

It could also be that some of the additional work-related emails we recovered were 
among those deleted as “personal” by Secretary Clinton’s lawyers when they 
reviewed and sorted her emails for production in 2014#. We have conducted 
interviews and done technical examination to attempt to understand how that 
sorting was done. Although we do not have complete visibility because we are not 





















fully able to reconstruct the electronic record of that sorting, we believe our 
investigation has been sufficient to give us reasonable confidence there was no 
intentional misconduct in connection with that sorting effort. 

The lawyers doing the sorting for Secretary Clinton in 20145 did not individually 
read the content of all of her tens of thousands of emails, as we did for those 
available to us ; instead, they used search terms to try to find all work-related 
emails among the reportedly more than 60,000 total emails remaining on Secretary 
Clinton’s private system in 20154. It is highly likely their search terms missed 
some work-related emails, and that we found them, for example, in the mailboxes 
of other officials or in the slack space of a server. It is also likely that there are 
other work-related emails that they did not produce to State and that we did not 
find elsewhere, and that are now gone because they deleted all emails they did not 
return to State, and the lawyers cleaned their devices in a such a way as to preclude 
forensic recovery. 

And, of course, in additional to our technical work, we interviewed many people, 
from those involved in setting up and maintaining the various iterations of 
Secretary Clinton’s private server to staff members with whom she corresponded 
on email, to those involved in the email production to State, and finally, Secretary 
Clinton herself. 


Lastly, we have done extensive work with the assistance of our colleagues 
elsewhere in the Intelligence Community to understand what indications there 
might be of compromise by hostile actors in connection with the private email 
operation. 


That’s what we have done. Now let me tell you what we found. 


Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues 

intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is 

evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive. 

highly classified information. There is evidence to support a conclusion that 
Secretary Clinton, and others, used the private email server in a manner that was 

grossly negligent with respect to the handling of classified information. For 
example, seven email chains concern matters that were classified at the TS/SAP 
level when they were sent and received. These chains involved Secretary Clinton 
both sending emails about those matters and receiving emails from others about the 

same matters. There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable 


Formatted: Highlight 


SJC000034 























person in Secretary Clinton’s position, or in the position of those government 
employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have 
known that an unclassified system was no place for such an email conversation. 
Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues 

intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is 
evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, 
highly classified information. 

Similarly, In addition to this highly sensitive information, we also found the sheer 
volume of information that was properly classified as Secret by the U.S. 
Intelligence Community at the time it was discussed on email (that is, excluding 
the “up classified” emails) . This is especially concerning because all of these 
emails were housed on servers not supported by full-time security staff, like those 

found at Departments and Agencies of the U.S. Government, supports an 
inference that the participants were grossly negligent in their handling of that 

information- 

W hile not the focus of our investigation, w e also developed evidence that the 
security culture of the State Department in general, and with respect to use of 
unclassified email systems in particular, was generally lacking in the kind of care 
for classified information found elsewhere in the government. 

With respect to potential computer intrusion by hostile actors, we did not find 
direct evidence that Secretary Clinton’s personal email system, in its various 
configurations since 2009, was successfully hacked. But, given the nature of the 
system and of the actors potentially involved, we assess that we would be unlikely 
to see such direct evidence. We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the 
private commercial email accounts of individuals with whom Secretary Clinton 
was in regular contact from her personal private account. We also assess that 
Secretary Clinton’s use of a private personal email domain was both known by a 
large number of people and readily apparent. Given that combination of factors, 
we assess it is reasonably likely possible that hostile actors gained access to 
Secretary Clinton’s private personal email account^ 

So that’s what we found. 

Finally, with respect to our recommendation to the Department of Justice. In 

our system, the prosecutors make the decisions about whether charges are 
appropriate based on evidence the FBI has helped collect. Although we don’t 


Commented [p5]: 


SJC000035 



































normally make public our recommendations to the prosecutors, we frequently 
make recommendations and engage in productive conversations with prosecutors 
about what resolution may be appropriate, given the evidence. In this case, given 
the importance of the matter, I think unusual transparency is in order. 


In looking back at our investigations in similar circumstances, we cannot find a 
case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. All the cases 
prosecuted involved some combination of: (1) clearly intentional mishandling of 
classified information; (2) vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to 
support an inference of intentional misconduct; (3) indications of disloyalty to the 
United States; or (4) efforts to obstruct justice. All charged cases of which we are 
aware have involved the accusation that a government employee intentionally 
mishandled classified information. We see none of that |here|. 

Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the 
handling of classified information, my judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor 
would bring such a case. Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before 
bringing charges. There are obvious considerations, like the strength of the 

evidence. But they must be balanced against things like the intent and context of 

the person’s actions. To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar 

circumstances, an individual who engaged in this activity would face NO 

consequences. To the contrary, such individuals are often subject to security or 

administrative sanctions. But that decision is not what is before me now. 


Commented [p6]: We changed none of this text, we simply 
reordered it. The original text is below, struck-out. 


Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statute proscribing gross 

negligence in the handling of classified information and of the statute proscribing 

misdemeanor mishandling, my judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would 

bring such a case. At the outset, we are not aware of a case where anyone has been 

charged solely based on the “gross negligence” prohibition in the [ statute - -In 


looking back at our investigations in similar circumstances, we cannot find a case 

that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. All the cases 

prosecuted involved some combination of: (1) clearly intentional misconduct; (2) 

vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of 

intentional misconduct; (3) indications of disloyalty to the United States; or ( 4 ) 

efforts to obstruct justice. We see none of that here. 


Commented [p7]: 


Accordingly, although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters 
such as this, I am completing the investigation by expressing to Justice my view 
that no charges are appropriate in this case. 


SJC000036 



























I know there will be intense public disagreement in the wake of this result, as there 
was throughout this investigation. What I can assure the American people is that 
this investigation was done competently, honestly, and independently. No outside 
influence of any kind was brought to bear. I know there were many opinions 
expressed by people who were not part of the investigation - including people in 
government - but none of that mattered to us. Opinions are irrelevant, and they 
were all uninformed by insight into our investigation, because we did the 
investigation in a professional way. Only facts matter, and the FBI found them 
here in an entirely apolitical and professional way. I couldn’t be prouder to be part 
of this organization.

SJC000059 






Good morning. I’m here to give you an update on the FBI’s investigation of 
Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal email system during her time as Secretary of 
State. 


After a tremendous amount of work over the last year, the FBI has finished 
its investigation and referred the case to the Department of Justice for a prosecutive 
decision. What I would like to do today is tell you three things: what we did; what 
we found; and what we have recommended to the Department of Justice. 

This will be an unusual statement in at least a couple ways. First, I am going 
to include more detail than I ordinarily would, because I think the American people 
deserve those details in a case of intense public interest. Second, I have not 
coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the Department of Justice 
or any other part of the government. They do not know what I am about to say. 

But I want to start by thanking the many FBI employees who did remarkable 
work in this case. Once you have a better sense of how much we have done, you 
will understand why I am so grateful and proud of their efforts. 

So, first, what we have done: 

The investigation began as a referral from the Intelligence Community 
Inspector General in connection with Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal email 
server during her time as Secretary of State. The referral focused on whether 
classified information was transmitted on that personal system. 

Our investigation looked at whether there is evidence that classified 
information was improperly stored or transmitted on that personal system, in 
violation of a federal statute that makes it a felony to mishandle classified 
information either intentionally or in a grossly negligent way, or a second statute 
that makes it a misdemeanor to knowingly remove classified information from 
appropriate systems or storage facilities. 

Consistent with our counter-intelligence responsibilities, we have also 
investigated to determine whether there is evidence of computer intrusion in 
connection with the personal email server by any foreign power, or other hostile 
actors. 


SJC000060 



I have so far used the singular term, “email server,” in describing the referral 
that began our investigation. It turns out to have been more complicated than that. 
Secretary Clinton used several different servers and administrators of those servers 
during her four years at the State Department, and used numerous mobile devices 
to view and send email on that personal domain. As new servers and equipment 
were employed, older servers were taken out of service, stored, and 
decommissioned in various ways. Piecing all of that back together — to gain as full 
an understanding as possible of the ways in which personal email was used for 
government work — has been a painstaking undertaking, requiring thousands of 
hours of effort. 

For example, when one of Secretary Clinton’s original personal servers was 
decommissioned in 2013, the email software was removed. Doing that didn’t 
remove the email content, but it was like removing the frame from a huge finished 
jigsaw puzzle and dumping the pieces on the floor. The effect was that millions of 
email fragments end up unsorted in the server’s un-used - or “slack” - space. We 
searched through all of it to see what was there, and what parts of the puzzle could 
be put back together. 

FBI investigators have also read all of the approximately 30,000 emails 
provided by Secretary Clinton to the State Department in December 2014. Where 
an email was assessed as possibly containing classified information, the FBI 
referred the email to any U.S. government agency that was a likely “owner” of 
information in the email, so that agency could make a determination as to whether 
the email contained classified information at the time it was sent or received, or 
whether there was reason to classify the email now, even if its content was not 
classified at the time it was sent (that is the process sometimes referred to as “up- 
classifying”). 

From the group of 30,000 emails returned to the State Departmen 
emails i email chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain 
classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains 
contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains 
contained Secret information at the time; an contained Confidential information, 
which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 
additional emails were “up-classified” to make them Confidential; the information 
in those had not been classified at the time the emails were sent. 

The FBI also discovered several thousand work-related emails that were not 
in the group of 30,000 that were returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014. 


SJC000061 





We found those additional emails in a variety of ways. Some had been deleted over 
the years and we found traces of them on devices that supported or were connected 
to the private email domain. Others we found by reviewing the archived 
government email accounts of people who had been government employees at the 
same time as Secretary Clinton, including high-ranking officials at other agencies, 
people with whom a Secretary of State might naturally correspond. This helped us 
recover work-related emails that were not among the 30,000 produced to State. 

Still others we recovered from the laborious review of the millions of email 
fragments dumped into the slack space of the server decommissioned in 2013. 

With respect to the thousands of emails we found that were not among those 
produced to State, agencies have concluded that xx of those were classified at the 
time they were sent or received, x at the Secret level and xx at the Confidential 
level. There were no additional Top Secret emails found. Finally, xx of those we 
found have since been “up-classified.” 

I should add here that we found no evidence that any of the additional work- 
related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them. Our 
assessment is that, like many email users, Secretary Clinton periodically deleted 
emails or emails were purged from the system when devices were changed. 
Because she was not using a government account - or even a commercial account 
like Gmail - there was no archiving at all of her emails, so it is not surprising that 
we discovered emails that were not on Secretary Clinton’s system in 2014, when 
she produced the 30,000 emails to the State Department. 

It could also be that some of the additional work-related emails we 
recovered were among those deleted as “personal” by Secretary Clinton’s lawyers 
when they reviewed and sorted her emails for production in 2014. 

The lawyers doing the sorting for Secretary Clinton in 2014 did not 
individually read the content of all of her emails, as we did for those available to 
us; instead, they relied on header information and used search terms to try to find 
all work-related emails among the reportedly more than 60,000 total emails 
remaining on Secretary Clinton’s personal system in 2014. It is highly likely their 
search terms missed some work-related emails, and that we later found them, for 
example, in the mailboxes of other officials or in the slack space of a server. 

It is also likely that there are other work-related emails that they did not produce to 
State and that we did not find elsewhere, and that are now gone because they 
deleted all emails they did not return to State, and the lawyers cleaned their devices 
in such a way as to preclude complete forensic recovery. 


SJC000062 



We have conducted interviews and done technical examination to attempt to 
understand how that sorting was done by her attorneys. Although we do not have 
complete visibility because we are not fully able to reconstruct the electronic 
record of that sorting, we believe our investigation has been sufficient to give us 
reasonable confidence there was no intentional misconduct in connection with that 
sorting effort. 

And, of course, in addition to our technical work, we interviewed many 
people, from those involved in setting up and maintaining the various iterations of 
Secretary Clinton’s personal server, to staff members with whom she corresponded 
on email, to those involved in the email production to State, and finally, Secretary 
Clinton herself. 

Last, we have done extensive work to understand what indications there 
might be of compromise by hostile actors in connection with the personal email 
operation. 

That’s what we have done. Now let me tell you what we found: 

Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her 
colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified 
information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling 
of very sensitive, highly classified information. 

For example, seven email chains concern matters that were classified at the 
Top Secret/Special Access Program level when they were sent and received. 

These chains involved Secretary Clinton both sending emails about those matters 
and receiving emails from others about the same matters. There is evidence to 
support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position, or 
in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding 
about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place 
for that conversation. In addition to this highly sensitive information, we also 
found information that was properly classified as Secret by the U.S. Intelligence 
Community at the time it was discussed on email (that is, excluding the later “up- 
classified” emails). 

None of these emails should have been on any kind of unclassified system, 
but their presence is especially concerning because all of these emails were housed 
on unclassified personal servers not even supported by full-time security staff, like 


SJC000063 



those found at Departments and Agencies of the U.S. Government - or even with a 
commercial service like Gmail. 

Separately, it is important to say something about the marking of classified 
information. Only a very small number of the emails containing classified 
information bore markings indicating the presence of classified information. But 
even if information is not marked “classified” in an email, participants who know 
or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it. 

While not the focus of our investigation, we also developed evidence that the 
security culture of the State Department in general, and with respect to use of 
unclassified email systems in particular, was generally lacking in the kind of care 
for classified information found elsewhere in the government. 

With respect to potential computer intrusion by hostile actors, we did not 
find direct evidence that Secretary Clinton’s personal email system, in its various 
configurations since 2009, was successfully hacked. But, given the nature of the 
system and of the actors potentially involved, we assess that we would be unlikely 
to see such direct evidence. We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the 
private commercial email accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in 
regular contact from her personal account. We also assess that Secretary Clinton’s 
use of a personal email domain was both known by a large number of people and 
readily apparent. She also used her personal email extensively while outside the 
United States, including from the territory of sophisticated adversaries. That use 
included an email exchange with the President while Secretary Clinton was on the 
territory of such an adversary. Given that combination of factors, we assess it is 
possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal email 
account. 

So that’s what we found. Finally, with respect to our recommendation to the 
Department of Justice: 

In our system, the prosecutors make the decisions about whether charges are 
appropriate based on evidence the FBI has helped collect. Although we don’t 
normally make public our recommendations to the prosecutors, we frequently 
make recommendations and engage in productive conversations with prosecutors 
about what resolution may be appropriate, given the evidence. In this case, given 
the importance of the matter, I think unusual transparency is in order. 


SJC000064 



Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding 
the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable 
prosecutor would bring such a case. Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of 
factors before bringing charges. There are obvious considerations, like the strength 
of the evidence, especially about intent. Responsible decisions also consider the 
context of a person’s actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the 
past. 


In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of 
classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal 
charges on these facts. All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: 
clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast 
quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of 
intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts 
to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here. 

To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who 
engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those 
individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. But that is not 
what we are deciding now. 

As a result, although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on 
matters like this, we are completing the investigation by expressing to Justice our 
view that no charges are appropriate in this case. 

I know there will be intense public debate in the wake of this 
recommendation, as there was throughout this investigation. What I can assure the 
American people is that this investigation was done competently, honestly, and 
independently. No outside influence of any kind was brought to bear. 

I know there were many opinions expressed by people who were not part of 
the investigation - including people in government - but none of that mattered to 
us. Opinions are irrelevant, and they were all uninformed by insight into our 
investigation, because we did the investigation the right way. Only facts matter, 
and the FBI found them here in an entirely apolitical and professional way. I 
couldn’t be prouder to be part of this organization.

SJC000073 






Good morning. I’m here to give you an update on the FBI’s investigation of 
Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal email system during her time as Secretary of 
State. 


After a tremendous amount of work over the last year, the FBI has finished 
its investigation and is referring the case to the Department of Justice for a 
prosecutive decision. What I would like to do today is tell you three things: what 
we did; what we found; and what we are recommending to the Department of 
Justice. 

This will be an unusual statement in at least a couple ways. First, I am going 
to include more detail than I ordinarily would, because I think the American people 
deserve those details in a case of intense public interest. Second, I have not 
coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the Department of Justice 
or any other part of the government. They do not know what I am about to say. 

I want to start by thanking the many FBI employees who did remarkable 
work in this case. Once you have a better sense of how much we have done, you 
will understand why I am so grateful and proud of their efforts. 

So, first, what we have done: 

The investigation began as a referral from the Intelligence Community 
Inspector General in connection with Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal email 
server during her time as Secretary of State. The referral focused on whether 
classified information was transmitted on that personal system. 

Our investigation looked at whether there is evidence that classified 
information was improperly stored or transmitted on that personal system, in 
violation of a federal statute that makes it a felony to mishandle classified 
information either intentionally or in a grossly negligent way, or a second statute 
that makes it a misdemeanor to knowingly remove classified information from 
appropriate systems or storage facilities. 

Consistent with our counter-intelligence responsibilities, we have also 
investigated to determine whether there is evidence of computer intrusion in 
connection with the personal email server by any foreign power, or other hostile 
actors. 


SJC000074 



I have so far used the singular term, “email server,” in describing the referral 
that began our investigation. It turns out to have been more complicated than that. 
Secretary Clinton used several different servers and administrators of those servers 
during her four years at the State Department, and used numerous mobile devices 
to view and send email on that personal domain. As new servers and equipment 
were employed, older servers were taken out of service, stored, and 
decommissioned in various ways. Piecing all of that back together — to gain as full 
an understanding as possible of the ways in which personal email was used for 
government work — has been a painstaking undertaking, requiring thousands of 
hours of effort. 

For example, when one of Secretary Clinton’s original personal servers was 
decommissioned in 2013, the email software was removed. Doing that didn’t 
remove the email content, but it was like removing the frame from a huge finished 
jigsaw puzzle and dumping the pieces on the floor. The effect was that millions of 
email fragments end up unsorted in the server’s un-used - or “slack” - space. We 
searched through all of it to see what was there, and what parts of the puzzle could 
be put back together. 

FBI investigators have also read all of the approximately 30,000 emails 
provided by Secretary Clinton to the State Department in December 2014. Where 
an email was assessed as possibly containing classified information, the FBI 
referred the email to any U.S. government agency that was a likely “owner” of 
information in the email, so that agency could make a determination as to whether 
the email contained classified information at the time it was sent or received, or 
whether there was reason to classify the email now, even if its content was not 
classified at the time it was sent (that is the process sometimes referred to as “up- 
classifying”). 

From the group of 30,000 emails returned to the State Departmen 
emails i email chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain 
classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains 
contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains 
contained Secret information at the time; an contained Confidential information, 
which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 
additional emails were “up-classified” to make them Confidential; the information 
in those had not been classified at the time the emails were sent. 

The FBI also discovered several thousand work-related emails that were not 


SJC000075 





in the group of 30,000 that were returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014. 

We found those additional emails in a variety of ways. Some had been deleted over 
the years and we found traces of them on devices that supported or were connected 
to the private email domain. Others we found by reviewing the archived 
government email accounts of people who had been government employees at the 
same time as Secretary Clinton, including high-ranking officials at other agencies, 
people with whom a Secretary of State might naturally correspond. This helped us 
recover work-related emails that were not among the 30,000 produced to State. 

Still others we recovered from the laborious review of the millions of email 
fragments dumped into the slack space of the server decommissioned in 2013. 

With respect to the thousands of emails we found that were not among those 
produced to State, agencies have concluded that xx of those were classified at the 
time they were sent or received, x at the Secret level and xx at the Confidential 
level. There were no additional Top Secret emails found. Finally, xx of those we 
found have since been “up-classified.” 

I should add here that we found no evidence that any of the additional work- 
related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them. Our 
assessment is that, like many email users, Secretary Clinton periodically deleted 
emails or emails were purged from the system when devices were changed. 
Because she was not using a government account - or even a commercial account 
like Gmail - there was no archiving at all of her emails, so it is not surprising that 
we discovered emails that were not on Secretary Clinton’s system in 2014, when 
she produced the 30,000 emails to the State Department. 

It could also be that some of the additional work-related emails we 
recovered were among those deleted as “personal” by Secretary Clinton’s lawyers 
when they reviewed and sorted her emails for production in 2014. 

The lawyers doing the sorting for Secretary Clinton in 2014 did not 
individually read the content of all of her emails, as we did for those available to 
us; instead, they relied on header information and used search terms to try to find 
all work-related emails among the reportedly more than 60,000 total emails 
remaining on Secretary Clinton’s personal system in 2014. It is highly likely their 
search terms missed some work-related emails, and that we later found them, for 
example, in the mailboxes of other officials or in the slack space of a server. 

It is also likely that there are other work-related emails that they did not produce to 
State and that we did not find elsewhere, and that are now gone because they 


SJC000076 



deleted all emails they did not return to State, and the lawyers cleaned their devices 
in such a way as to preclude complete forensic recovery. 


We have conducted interviews and done technical examination to attempt to 
understand how that sorting was done by her attorneys. Although we do not have 
complete visibility because we are not able to fully reconstruct the electronic 
record of that sorting, we believe our investigation has been sufficient to give us 
reasonable confidence there was no intentional misconduct in connection with that 
sorting effort. 

And, of course, in addition to our technical work, we interviewed many 
people, from those involved in setting up and maintaining the various iterations of 
Secretary Clinton’s personal server, to staff members with whom she corresponded 
on email, to those involved in the email production to State, and finally, Secretary 
Clinton herself. 

Last, we have done extensive work to understand what indications there 
might be of compromise by hostile actors in connection with the personal email 
operation. 

That’s what we have done. Now let me tell you what we found: 

Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her 
colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified 
information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling 
of very sensitive, highly classified information. 

For example, seven email chains concern matters that were classified at the 
Top Secret/Special Access Program level when they were sent and received. 

These chains involved Secretary Clinton both sending emails about those matters 
and receiving emails from others about the same matters. There is evidence to 
support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position, or 
in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding 
about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place 
for that conversation. In addition to this highly sensitive information, we also 
found information that was properly classified as Secret by the U.S. Intelligence 
Community at the time it was discussed on email (that is, excluding the later “up- 
classified” emails). 


SJC000077 



None of these emails should have been on any kind of unclassified system, 
but their presence is especially concerning because all of these emails were housed 
on unclassified personal servers not even supported by full-time security staff, like 
those found at Departments and Agencies of the U.S. Government - or even with a 
commercial service like Gmail. 

Separately, it is important to say something about the marking of classified 
information. Only a very small number of the emails containing classified 
information bore markings indicating the presence of classified information. But 
even if information is not marked “classified” in an email, participants who know 
or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it. 

While not the focus of our investigation, we also developed evidence that the 
security culture of the State Department in general, and with respect to use of 
unclassified email systems in particular, was generally lacking in the kind of care 
for classified information found elsewhere in the government. 

With respect to potential computer intrusion by hostile actors, we did not 
find direct evidence that Secretary Clinton’s personal email domain, in its various 
configurations since 2009, was successfully hacked. But, given the nature of the 
system and of the actors potentially involved, we assess that we would be unlikely 
to see such direct evidence. We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the 
private commercial email accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in 
regular contact from her personal account. We also assess that Secretary Clinton’s 
use of a personal email domain was both known by a large number of people and 
readily apparent. She also used her personal email extensively while outside the 
United States, including from the territory of sophisticated adversaries. That use 
included an email exchange with another senior government official while 
Secretary Clinton was in the territory of such an adversary. Given that 
combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to 
Secretary Clinton’s personal email account. 

So that’s what we found. Finally, with respect to our recommendation to the 
Department of Justice: 

In our system, the prosecutors make the decisions about whether charges are 
appropriate based on evidence the FBI has helped collect. Although we don’t 
normally make public our recommendations to the prosecutors, we frequently 
make recommendations and engage in productive conversations with prosecutors 


SJC000078 



about what resolution may be appropriate, given the evidence. In this case, given 
the importance of the matter, I think unusual transparency is in order. 

Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding 
the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable 
prosecutor would bring such a case. Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of 
factors before bringing charges. There are obvious considerations, like the strength 
of the evidence, especially about intent. Responsible decisions also consider the 
context of a person’s actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the 
past. 


In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of 
classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal 
charges on these facts. All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: 
clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast 
quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of 
intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts 
to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here. 

To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who

TRANSITORY RECORD 

I’ve been trying to imagine what it would look like if I decided to do an FBI only press event 
to close out our work and hand the matter to DOJ. To help shape our discussions of whether 
that, or something different, makes sense, I have spent some time crafting what I would say, 
which follows. In my imagination, I don’t see me taking any questions. Here is what it might 
look like: 


Good afternoon folks. I am here to give you an update on our investigation of Secretary' Clinton's use 
of a private email system, which began in late August. 

After a tremendous amount of work, the FBI has completed its investigation and has referred the case 
to the Department of Justice for a prosecutive decision. What I would like to do today is tell you 
three things: (1) what we did; (2) what we found; (3) what we have recommended to DOJ. 

But I want to start by thanking the many agents, analysts, technologists, and other FBI employees who 
did work of extraordinary' quality in this case. Once you have a better sense of how much we have 
done, you will understand why I am so grateful and proud of their efforts. 

So, first: what we have done over the last eight months. 

The investigation began as a referral from the Intelligence Community' Inspector General in 
connection with Secretary' Clinton's use of a private email server during his time as Secretary' of State, 
focused on whether classified information was transmitted on that private system. 

Our investigation focused on whether there is evidence that classified information was improperly 
stored or transmitted on that private system, in violation of a federal statute that makes it a felony to 
mishandle classified information either intentionally or in a grossly negligent way, or a second statute 
that makes it a misdemeanor to remove classified information from appropriate systems or storage 
facilities. 


Consistent with our counterintelligence responsibilities, we have also investigated to determine 
whether there is evidence of computer intrusion in connection with the private email server by any 
foreign power, or hackers on behalf of a foreign power.

investigation. It turns out to have been more complicated than that. Secretary Clinton used several 
different servers and providers of those servers during her four years at the State Department, and used 
numerous mobile devices to view and send email on that private domain. As new servers and providers 
were employed, older servers were taken out of service, stored, and decommissioned in various ways. 
Piecing all of that back together to gain as full an understanding as possible of the ways in which 
private email was used for government work has been a painstaking undertaking, requiring thousands of 
hours of effort. 

For example, when one of Secretary' Clinton's original private servers was decommissioned in 20xx. 
the email software was removed. Doing that didn’t remove the email content, but it was like removing 
the frame from a huge finished jigsaw puzzle and dumping the pieces on the floor. The effect was that 
millions of email fragments end up unsorted in the server’s un-used - or "slack” - space. We went 
through all of it to see what was there, and what parts of the puzzle could be put back together. 

FBI investigators have also read all 34.000 emails provided by Secretary' Clinton to the State 
Department in spring 2015. Where an email was assessed as possibly containing classified 
information, the FBI referred the email to the U.S. government agency that was the likely “owner” of 
the information in the email so that agency could make a determination as to whether the email 
contained classified information at the time it was sent or received, or whether there was reason to 
classify the email now. even if its content was not classified at the time it was sent (this is the process 
sometimes referred to as “up classifying”). 

From that group of 34.000 emails that had been returned to the State Department in 2015. the FBI sent 
xxxx emails to agencies for classification determinations. Of those, xxxx have been determined to 
contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Xxxx of those contained 
information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; xxxx contained Secret information at the 
time; and xxxx contained Confidential information. Separate from those, a total of xxxx additional 
emails were up classified” to make them Secret or Confidential; the information in those had not 
been classified at the time the emails were sent. 

The FBI also discovered xxxx work-related emails that were not in the group of 34.000 that were

Some had been deleted over the years and we found traces of them on devices that supported or were

State. Still others we recovered from the laborious review of the millions of email fragments dumped

All told, we found xxxx emails that were not among those produced to the State Department last year. 
Of those, we assessed that xxxx possibly contained classified information at the time they were sent 
or received and so we sent them to other government agencies for classification determinations. To 
date, agencies have concluded that xxxx of those were classified at the time thev were sent or 
received, xxx at the Secret level and xxxx at the Confidential level. There were no additional Top 
Secret emails found. Finally, none of those we found have since been up classified.” 

I should add here that we found no evidence that any of the additional work-related emails we found 
were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them. Our assessment is that, like many users of 
private email accounts. Secretary' Clinton periodically deleted emails or emails were purged from the 


SJC000141 


system when devices were changed. Because she was not using a government account, there was no 
archiving of her emails, so it is not surprising that we discovered emails that were not on Secretary' 
Clinton’s system in 2015. when she produced the 34 ; 000 emails to the State Department. 

It could also be that some of the additional work-related emails we recovered were among those 
deleted as 'personal” by Secretary' Clinton s lawyers when they reviewed and sorted her emails for 
production in 2015. We have conducted interviews and done technical examination to attempt to 
understand how that sorting was done. Although we do not have complete visibility' because we are not 
fully able to reconstruct the electronic record of that sorting, we believe our investigation has been 
sufficient to give us reasonable confidence there was no intentional misconduct in connection with 
that sorting effort. 

The lawyers doing the sorting for Secretary' Clinton in 2015 did not individually read tens of thousands 
of emails, as we did; instead, they used search terms to try to find all work-related emails among the 
more than 60.000 total emails remaining on Secretary' Clinton’s private system in 2015. It is highly 
likely their search terms missed some work-related emails, and that we found them, for example, in 
the mailboxes of other officials or in the slack space of a server. It is also likely that there are other 
work-related emails that they did not produce to State and that we did not find elsewhere, and that are 
now gone because they deleted all emails they did not return to State, and the lawyers cleaned their 
devices in a such a way as to preclude forensic recovery. 

And. of course, in additional to our technical work, we interviewed many people, from those involved 
in setting up and maintaining the various iterations of Secretary Clinton’s private server to staff 
members with whom she corresponded on email, to those involved in the email production to State, 
and finally. Secretary Clinton herself. 

Lastly, we have done extensive work with the assistance of our colleagues elsewhere in the 
Intelligence Community' to understand what indications there might be of compromise by hostile 
actors in connection with the private email operation. 

That’s what we have done. Now let me tell you what we found. 


There is evidence to support a conclusion that Secretary Clinton, and others, used the private email 
server in a manner that was grossly negligent with respect to the handling of classified information. 
For example, seven email chains concern matters that were classified at the TS/SAP level when they 
were sent and received. These chains involved Secretary Clinton both sending emails about those 
matters and receiving emails from others about the same matters. There is evidence to support a 
conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary' Clinton’s position, or in the positon of those 
government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that 
an unclassified system was no place for such an email conversation. Although we did not find clear 
evidence that Secretary' Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of 
classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very' 
sensitive, highly classified information. 

Similarly, the sheer volume of information that was properly classified as Secret at the time it was 
discussed on email (that is. excluding the "up classified” emails) supports an inference that the 
participants were grossly negligent in their handling of that information. 


We also developed evidence that the security' culture of the State Department in general, and with 
respect to use of unclassified email systems in particular, was generally lacking in the kind of care for 


/•* 1 a o r> t alomtrlviaria flva At f 


SJC000142 


imaaiucu miuiiiiaiiuii iuuiiu ciaovucic m me guvciiniieui. 


With respect to potential computer intrusion by hostile actors, we did not find direct evidence that 
Secretary' Clinton's personal email system, in its various configurations since 2009. was successfully 
hacked. But. given the nature of the system and of the actors potentially involved, we assess that we 
would be unlikely to see such direct evidence. We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the 
private email accounts of individuals with whom Secretary' Clinton was in regular contact from her 
private account. We also assess that Secretary' Clinton's use of a private email domain was both 
known by a large number of people and readily apparent. Given that combination of factors, we asses 
it is reasonably likely that hostile actors gained access to Secretary' Clinton's private email account. 

So that’s what we found. 

Finally, with respect to our recommendation to the Department of Justice. In our system, the 
prosecutors make the decisions about whether charges are appropriate based on evidence the FBI has 
helped collect. Although we don't normally make public our recommendations to the prosecutors, we 
frequently make recommendations and engage in productive conversations with prosecutors about 
what resolution may be appropriate, given the evidence. In this case, given the importance of the 
matter. I think unusual transparency is in order. 

Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statute proscribing gross negligence in the 
handling of classified information and of the statute proscribing misdemeanor mishandling, my 
judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. At the outset, we are not aware of 
a case where anyone has been charged solely based on the ''gross negligence” prohibition in the 
statute. All charged cases of which we are aware have involved the accusation that a government 
employee intentionally mishandled classified information. In looking back at our investigations in 
similar circumstances, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these 
facts. All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: (1) clearly intentional misconduct; (2) 
vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional 
misconduct; (3) indications of disloyalty to the United States; or (4) efforts to obstruct justice. We 
see none of that here. 

Accordingly, although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters such as this. I am 
completing the investigation by expressing to Justice my view that no charges are appropriate in this 
case. 

I know there will be intense public disagreement in the wake of this result, as there was throughout this 
investigation. What I can assure the American people is that this investigation was done competently, 
honestly, and independently. No outside influence of any kind was brought to bear. I know there were 
many opinions expressed by people who were not part of the investigation — including people in 
government - but none of that mattered to us. Opinions are irrelevant, and they were all uninformed 
by insight into our investigation, because we did the investigation in a professional way. Only facts 
matter, and the FBI found them here in an entirely apolitical and professional way. I couldn't be 
prouder to be part of this organization.

Yeah, though more important is his agent and analytic corps and they

Already driving. How was the walk with 5 1 like having her on the 

team, but I was discouraged that she was so busy she was going to 
have or somebody else start covering for her 

sometimes.\n\nDespite my personal interaction with him. I'm just not 
sure about his temperament in this project. 

2015-08-24 
11:17:53, Mon 

OUTBOX 

No you're right. He's a petulant baby (remind me to tell you his latest 
fit with her). She's being told that this new case (that's all she would 
say to me), followed by dead people. 

So I'd be surprised if she hands off too much to him. More that she's 
going to have to let him handle more of which she doesn't really 

want to do.

Yeah. Look, he hasn't even started the job. And it's tough to slot you

You have any idea this was coming?\n\nJustice Dept. Says Hillary 


Clinton Had Authority to Delete Certain Emails 


http://nyti.ms/lMhHPA3\n\n 


No idea about doj statement. We're trying to 


get a copy of original filing. We think it says she was requires to 
preserve copies of things that were records and could delete the rest 


but that the filing is being taken out of context and spun. But who 


What isn't clear from the article is whether or not they (doj) speak to 
the issue of whether or not she had authority to be operating off of a 
private server. 


B) is very nice but she's no Lisa Page. JG wanted something on 

Fri, So i sent an email this morning at 830 to her and oroposing 

how to handle it—crickets... __ 

So I think I've decided that I'm not going to start until Thursday my 
first week back, then the following week has a fed holiday so it's only 
a 4 day week, 

so I 

might take that Monday off as well, just so I can ease back in. 
Especially if it's still not clear what I'll be doing. \U0001f612 

Or in the alternative, maybe I'll start on Wednesday but just work half 

days thru thatfriday. __ 

Or, log into eras and do your mandatory training and milk another 
week. \n\nBefore you start working with |...;)_ 


! Talked to Gregg about Randy's offer. His advice is take what I'll enjoy, 
as I have options...plus a ton of more detail about upcoming 

personnel moves.... _ 

Be, not me. 

Yep. Seems like I want my cake and eat it, too... 

So that's a no cpc move? I still say start your ses clock, although 

there's no doubt you will have options. _ 

Np. Briefing to D we thought was on the 28th is now tomorrow at 

2....glad we 're s o prep ared...we will be, but still _ 

Yikes, but you'll be completely great... 

Honestly, l thought it was weird that he would let you brief clapper 
before he got a recent update...

What a joke: \nStill, there was progress. Never before had China 
agreed with Mr. Obama\u2019s fundamental premise that the theft 
of intellectual property for commercial gain was off limits. After weeks 
of behind-the-scenes negotiations with the Chinese leadership, first in 
Beijing in late August and then with a delegation of nearly 50 senior 
Chinese officials who came to Washington quietly two weeks ago, 
Beijing agreed to wording that read: \u201cNeither country\u2019s 
government will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of 
intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential 
business information, with the intent of providing competitive 
advantages to companies or commercial sectors.\u201d\n\nLimiting

Hey heading into hq. Hit me on imsg later. I'll try to get a pass and 

figure out wh ere to meet. __ 

1 Will do. I called and left yet another message for Jim baker. I think I'm 
just going to have to tell tomorrow -1 think we are planning on 
walking, no doubt she is going to ask when I returning and what in 
going to be doing. I am quite frustrated. \U0001f612 


unny feeling to have a PT test. It was such a regular 
part of the Army, it brings back memories, mostly not positive. Oh 

well. __ 

; You're going to be fine. 






Walked and talked with HWerrtokayl 

Will have 

to talk to you about it later, but if I had to bet, I'd guess I'm going back 
to nslb. Apparently Trisha has spoken to her and about it, is 
clearly where she is leaning too. 


Well, it's good 


in this instance. Of course I want 


to talk about it, not even sure if I can make it to lunch I

Hopefully she has some ideas about what happens if you leave in 4 
months....or less....

keep her from leaving as early as she wanted to. And CyD is WILDLY 
disfunctional. 1 mean really bad. They can do individual investigations

your chain of command (and 1 know attys are much more flat than

hurting you (other than your ego). You're plenty talented. Everyone

nl feel like my calendar is pretty full this 
week, have a vague sense of "better busy yourself up this week" if I 
recall correctly. I'll probably just go in and check email, but I'm not sure 
there's much else fun to do down there. 

\U0001f636\n\n Higher up work people (the 
ones you mentioned, Mark and JG, or Randy, for that matter) wouldn't. 
And yes. I'm TOTALLY the same. I may unnecessarily care what people 
think way more than you. I'm trying to get a comfort with sense of self 
where I don't care. It's not so much on the professional work side (I 
know I'm good enough that I can be confident and humble there) buy 
on the interpersonal side. 



No. Briefing on cpc issue 


Whatever. Can't fool me. :D\n\nCall me though. Have a work question 
to ask you. 


Sorry still free to talk in 5?

He hasn't called, but in my sheepishness, I told him tomorrow was fine

And respecting your family time (and probably driving you crazy) he'll 

wait... _ 

He just texted me to hit him up tomorrow, so that’s good. 


Ha. \n\nProbably right. \n\nJust calt him now? J*sus, get it over with. 


At a minimum he's got the drive home. 

No, he said tomorrow. I need to respect that. It's okay. I just meant it 
wouldn't help/hurt my sleep any more or less than it usually does. 

It’s just you have a very ready stable of people to schedule into the void

I'm not sure 1 agree. If trisha's whole point of putting :here is to

forward a couple of emails - not a perfect example but maybe a little 
demonstrative. There are other "special counsels", the D's, one in OCA.

Pretty important to me, actually. Especially if 1 plan to leave the bureau,

I'll be doing and 2) Rybicki has made pretty clear he's opposed to me

Trisha knows you are imminently capable. She knows he's a d*ck. It will 

be o k. ,_ 

Yes, but my reputation is that I have "sharp elbows." So yes, I'm 
capable, but she doesn't necessarily know whether I played a role in 
this going south. 


One data point. She will have a thousand. And she already has many 

with you. \U0001f636 \U0001f636 \U0001f6 36_ 

Kill him with kindness. You have far, far - wildly so - more power. 

Why does HE bother you so? 


They all do. It's not just him. Honestly, because I'm painted unfairly. 
And I KNOW it's because of jealousy and I KNOW there's nothing I can 
do about it. But my sense of fairness is as foundational a part of me as 
literally any single trait I can think of. It's why I'm in government, why 
public service is a calling for me. So I think it is just very hard for me to 
let go when something is unfair. 


Yeah there's no good answer to the fairness thing, \n\nl lovehate him. I 
get it. 


Well, mostly hate. Shame\U0001f61e 

That sucks. I'm sorry. How are you feeling about after a night of 

ladmittedly poor sleep? _ 

! I don't know. Whatever. Angry. Resolved to leave ogc after this. 
Probably not going to say anything and will just steam inside instead. 

Well at a minimum, I think you should talk to Jason. Even if it doesn't 
change anything decision wise, it's another voice to confirm that you're 
doing the right thing, even if that's not particularly satisfying. 


Just had a great convo with one of the two new agents that the section 
picked up today. I knew her from WFO, public corruption agent. She's 
very excited and told me that she wouldn't let me down and that I 
wouldn't regret it. So that makes me happy.\U0001f60a

Well, except Trisha works with Bill and JG. Though this ail explains JG's 
"you and Jon should go, split them up, with at all of them." 

Because he's got Jim and Trisha pushing her (as they did with 
at State, in front of the Deputy and the D, without raising it before hand 
-1 agreed to it, because 1 thought they were right, though 1 was a little 
cranky about being put into a spot where 1 would potentially have to 
argue otherwise in that group), and JG’s experience is having a senior 
guy there. \n\nBecause it's a great spot for me to be in to be telling doj 
"fewer people " while 1 simultaneously argue for two more for us.

Sorry still on phone. Issue is if Laufman makes himself one of the two

the best two. And what "best" means isn't clear to me in this context.

Do you or Bill fundamentally believe that 3 and 3 is the RIGHT thing for 
the case? If the answer is no, then you call aack and say we're good 

as is. You have never wavered from saying 2 and 2 is best. 1 don't get 
what the hesitation is now.

how much churn has gone on this. Have a good night."\n\nAnd he just

Weak. Not surprised though.

And it frustrates me, because Bill; at his 7:15, brings up the whole 
matter in front of his DADs. One who is acting for Dina. Who 
immediately goes to John and tell him how Bill is stressed because all 
the stuff is going on about a special prosecutor. Bill needs to learn to 
not talk to everybody about this when he’s upset about it. And I 
guarantee that agent, while discreet, is certainly going to tell at least a 
few other 

people.\U0001f621\U0001f621\U0001f62l\U0001f62l\U0001f62l\UO

Thinking about earlier, 1 regret not saying more to.you and Jim. 1 should

Sorry, have been on with Bill P for the last 45 or so. He hadn't received

1 do like him. He gets nuance. 1 wonder if he gets intimidated/nervous

He is. 1 think he was pretty offended by my back and forth with randy.

02:33:33, Sat 

INBOX 

It's not intimidation. Which is why 1 get a little angry at doing the 

imitation thing. He's not weak - to the extent he has a weakness, it's the

than it is. But it is genuine without guile.

Yes, he was very clear that particularly in that small group, he values my 
views as much as theirs (at a minimum), and that he fully

Can someone who

Yes, of course! Someone is weak, insecure, threatened, whatever, and 
act like an asshole as a defense mechanism. I'm just telling you,

posture was agressive, like he couldn't believe he had to justify himself

Just read your last lync - that's REALLY frustrating. \n\nBecause it's 
ok for Mike and Randy to have multiple people like^ff and

So look, you say we text on that phone when we talk about hillary 
because it can't be traced, you were just venting be you feel bad 
that you're gone so much but it can't be helped right now. 

Right. But did you say anything other than work? I didj^^m 

Btw, he got neither of the two asac jobs he was in for earlier, and 
saidm (who sits on the asac board) said he wasn't getting 
Milwaukee, coming up. Talked about him with Bill, too. He's of the 
same mind I am. \n\nGotta figure out what to do with 

That sucks aboutDo they have any suggestions? 


idea what to do about^^f. Probably suggest he try a different 
division (ct? lod?) to expand his experience. 

I told you the story from^^J about Andy getting his number? 

No, don't think I know the andy^^J story. Or if I do I don't 

remember. _ 

Pretty sure I told you - Mike heimbach lamenting how bad it was 
and what they'd have to do to get him selected for wfo. Anyway, I

No. You're a professional and someone who works in the office of 
the highest ranking agent in the FBI. You behave professionally and 

appropriately. _ 

You remain above the fray because that's the right thing to do, not 

because you're a woman or young or a n ything else . _ 

Everyone gets^H was out of line. 

I don't believe that for a second. 

And he was perfectly fine in the meeting. Which means the "out of 

line" has be e n happe ning since the n. _ _ 

And remember -1 didn't tell this to^H because I had forgotten - 
you whispered it to me, and only after George said "share your 

wisdom with the group" did you mention it. _ 

He wasn't perfectly fine in the meeting. I thought he was angry and 
you were leaving. \n\nWhich part of what I said don't you believe? 
And what do you mean by out if line has been happening since the 

meeting* _ 

That everyone gets he was out of line. 

It's the part that keeps coming up with I have not heard 
anything from anyone else in the meeting (other than 
talking ABOUT^H). Because, I suspect, that was on him to 
research/speak to and he didn't and it was questioned.

And no, 1 don't have a problem with how he was in the meeting at

He was angry and talked to me - after 1 brought it up - and with 
j|||||||. He may have spoken to^^^f after 1 brought it up with 


him. \n\nl think - and I may wrong - you are conflating the motives 


behind Randy Andy and 


with the ones at the meeting. The 


former is more along the lines of what you're saying. The meeting 
wasn't a function of yur age or gender. would have 
responded exactly the same way to a 45 year old male from the 
DD's office saying what you did.

1 guess. 1 would probably be more direct - they don't know you 
from adam, why are they supposed to take your word for it? 
Especially when they're all used to the no brigade at DOJ. And if it

much work to demonstrate that to everyone.

it's also defending a friend, a 

colleague, who 1 have immense respect for. Whose back 1

perspective on privilege, tell him he's been an ass, and defend you.

And I'm just telling you it's pointless. Because he's not going to 
care what you have to say about me, or^H or baker or 
whomever, and he's not going to care or listen to the notion that 
he's been an ass. He's the most aggressive prosecutor any agent 
has ever worked with. \n\nRe the understanding his view on 
privilege, he's going to have to explain that - to lawyers, not agents 

- whether you say anything or not. _

2016-04-08 OUTBOX Maybe it is a friend thing. I gotta say, when he sent the email, and 

00:19:35, Fri then was so concerned by my reaction that he followed up with 


that call, my overall feeling was "oh good, he cares!" I'm even okay 
with him caring out of a selfish desire because he really wants me 
to keep working for him. And so now I just feel like a suckered 
maybe? Guess he didn't care enough. 

I don't know. That's the best I can come up with. 

I'd feel that way. No doubt about it. \n\nBut see what I just 
imsged. I don't know if "friendship" changes when it's a superior - 
subordinate relationship, particularly when it's an advisor - high 
ranking dynamic (in other words, I think it's different - some - from 
my relationship with^^^^^^^J) 

And interesting how elusive it is (for me, too!) to put ones finger 
on. \n\nl guess for me it's the thought (hope) that he's a stand up 
guy. And this is not stand up behavior. And when it's about YOU 
that's extra hard.\n\nLet me ask this (though maybe it doesn't 
translate). What would Giacalone do? 

I do think it's because he's my friend too. And honestly, I know he's 
my vast superior, but he's never treated me like that. Nor I him. So 

mostly I do just consider him my friend. _ 

Re giacalone, I really don't know. I think he would have taken it 
head on and addressed it, but he's such a different person, he 
would have done it in an awkward shucks-y way. Andy's not like 
that, just has to be earnest and direct, which is harder. John would 
say, "hey c'mon go easy on her. She's helping me out, means no 
harm, etc." I think? But what do I know. 

2016-04-08 OUTBOX Remind me to tell you what came up st the end of convo with

I know. He's such a douche wad. 

And sigh. His underlying emotional terrain certainly complicates it. 
And kudos to you for being sensitive to it \n\nYou're a good 
woman, Charlie Brown.;) 

I know who^J is.;) 

Stupid autocorrect undermined my gentle snark.^^J... 

I have had correspondence from him to me explaining how I was 
undermining his clients God and Constitutionally given rights. 

You should really stop doing that. 

Not following - he needs a softer touch? 

I know. I am The Man. \n\nBernie loving^J would hate me 

Do you think I'm misplaying not having David there with^^^| 
and ^|? 

If you doH then just do the whole team. 3 out of the 4 is 
ridiculous. So yeah, then I would just do the whole team. 

No, would just be^^^f and \n\nOr add David and m 

Just add them both, do it all at once. Then there's no grounds for 
complaint about that. 

Gotta go get Laufman

Because you know where I was on Thursday or Friday night - when 
I was complaining about everyone expecting me to deliver the hard 
message while they vacillated in discussing with their counterparts. 
About how my sense of justness and character was at odds with 
waiting until Sat to say something. \n\nAnd rightfully, you point 
out stop being so prima donna-ish and just do it. \n\nAnd i do. 
\n\nAnd then I find out an hour later that in addition to what I was 
asked to do, JB went to counsel and had the discussion he did. And 
I'm the one facing the music. From some who I have known for a 
long time. Nobody else pays the price. Nobody else will have the 
same straight hard discussion. Yet I'm the only one who violated 
his sense of integrity to swallow hard and deliver the message.

I'm not sure if I want to be part of this 

You are a part of this and that's not going to change. But I think 
you have every right to be angry and frustrated about being left 
out of the loop on your investigation, especially when you're going 
to be left holding the bag. And I think you're entitled to say 
something to Baker about that, though on this one I would 

probably discu ss w ith Bill first. _ 

I'm sorry^^f Big big case, big big problems. But God knows 

you're still the right guy to do it.F!1133 _ 

Gmailed you two drafts of what I'm thinking of sending Bill, would 
appreciate your thoughts. Second (more recent) is updated so you 

can skip the first. _ 

Andy just called to make sure I had heard everything. Call when 

you're free _ _ 

Bill wants to talk to me at 1215... 

Just talked with Bill, who spoke with 
everyone this morning. Will fill you in tonight or tomorrow. 
\n\nAlso, he was under the impression Andy wanted the meeting 
and a prebrief with FBI only just before. I think may have 
screwed up that scheduling. Can you check? Obviously want to 
confirm with him before going toB^jff 
We talked for 45 minutes... 

Wow. Can you talk now? 

Sent email to andy re pre-brief. Will let you know what he says. 

Will wait to reach out to^^l re call-in line until I hear from him.

My point in forwarding the email was to talk about how we get to 
a productive pla ce 

We'll get there, but for this meeting I'd solely just be taking^m 
lead. 

Well sure, but would be nice to know what that lead is in advance 
rather than, I don't know, f*ck me in the *ss wirhout saying 
anything, kinda like^ calling counsel the night before. \n\nToo 
much negative done to expect benefit of the doubt. 

Maybe we can find some time to talk today 
about the MYE thing? Really need to put it to rest. Certainly before 

the meeting tomorrow, if I can. _ 

I will. I promise. 

Btw, forgot to mentiom, Bill had me forward invite tomorrow to 
m \U0001f612 
Are you serious? 

Yep. Came up in the meeting. 

Spoke to^^^J need to talk to you at some point. Not urgent, so 

can certainly wait 

so free to talk. 

Hi. I can talk now. 

Thank you. \U0001f636 \n\nWas obviously constrained on my 
comments. What I identified IS what bothers me the most. And the 

rest is nonsense. _ 

And I think that frustration is fair. But it doesn't change the 
fundamental okay-ness of the prior two decisions (the summation 
and the call to her). It just means it would be best to handle it 
differently in the future. And Jim WILL understand that. Just talk to 
him, one on one. You don't need to get Bill's permission, clear 
through him, just go talk to him. It will all be fine. 

I will. He told Bill on Monday he'd be happy to talk to me any time.

And how much should I reach out to^^^f? He's still genuinely 
hurt. I may have been a bit callous this afternoon. Or at least, 
tough lo ve. _ 

You should not reach out to^^^f. Jesus, he's an adult. He 

should act like one. _ 

Sigh. Agreed. My soft heart feels badly. 

And still in

Hi going to try and catch Bill 

Still in with andy 

Hey are you ok if I pass to team (including doj) that as of last eve, 

JB has not talked with|^B?\n\nAlso, thinking about setting up 
meeting with Brooks and you,^H, Moffa. Want him to hear legal 
reasons why we need extraordinary measures, see interest of 
office of DD, and give him a little prep time for his folks to get him 

options (if any) _ 

Yes. Just so you know, he waited to call her until Monday (on 
purpose, wanted to resist the she calls and we jump), as of 
yesterday afternoon she hadn't responded. \n\nThat's fine too.

I wish Steve was alive. He would absolutely know this answer. 

\U0001f61e\n\nHow much do bar regs vary? 

Some, but this big of a difference would be really anomalous. 

Talking with^^^f.^^^^ specifically asked him NOT to talk to 

me until AFTER he talked to Andy 

Uh okay. And he waited three days because?... 

No. Just now. Tonght. About this afternoons covo 

Conversation. 

The 2:00 you mean? 

Tell you what,^J can come lead this fucking case with^^^f. I'l 

go work cases and get my car back _ 

I'll mention to andy. Why did George insist on that? 

Read the email I just sent, note bcc 

Because is playing the you're not getting accurate 

information" game and is allowing it to happen. 


Fuck thid 
That's not okay. 

This. Thanks Samsung 
Hell no it's not. 

We will fix this. 

Bullshit. We will puss out. If I got a quarter of the support^

If he had any dignity at all, he'd 


give you, us, some credit for the persistence in this area. They just 
suck so much. I hope^Hj has the self-awareness and character to 

do so. _ 

Talked to him just now, too. More info about George go if direct 
with Andy - concern about info JB didn't have about the case in the 
context of his discussion with^J, and the implication of the 
faulty telephone process going on with info flow in the fbi 
\U0001f612 _ 


OUTBOX 

Can you talk now? 

INBOX 

I'll of course give 


you a complete dump about what^^Bsaid/whenever you 


want.H2010 

INBOX 

Thanks for observations about JB. Cost of doing business if D and 
DD are going to use him. 

OUTBOX 

And also, he's not "the team." This is all a red herring. 

OUTBOX 

Pisses me off a little that Andy hasn't called back. 1 guess it's 
possible he's still at dinner... 

INBOX 

Who's not the team - JB? Fine, but D and dd decided to use him. 


And ifaccurate, was the cause of wondering what info is or 
isnt passed up. After all, of JB doesn't know that, what doesn't 

Andy know? _ 

Yeah I get it, but George KNOWS jb. This is all bs. Whatever, I'm 
just irritated.

I am too. This also plays into "Georges special relationship" with 

Andy_ _ 

Think we should touch topic of during D brief? 

Hmm. Let me get to you aboutthatone^^^Btalked to me this am 
about jb and ta's position re haven't had a 

cha nce to dig in yet. _ _ 

And please re Andy don't go too far. He (and J) knows we are 
close, right? And while what you're saying is exactly right, would 

you say it for any schmuck? _ 

Probably not, but you're not any schmuck. 

\U0001f636\U0001f636\U0001f636 (damn right \U0001f609)\n\nl 
think we mention that part (specifically that we're cleared to go 
back to task). I was talking about the specific allegation. We 
haven't discussed with him in a briefing we've given. I almost want 
to do it so 1) he knows we're aware 2) demonstrate that to Trisha 
and whoever else is deep in the "secret secret, ive got a secret" 
mindset and 3) get a sense of what he's thinking. 

I just think andy is probably keeping him appraised of this, but we 
can talk about it. 

Agree. It is substantive in that it is relevant to the case, just not 
sure if there is a decision point or information he would want in 

the context if his thinking about the issue. _ 

Yeah, can maybe have bill ask andy, but otherwise don't think it's 

probably n ec essary. _ _ 

Ha. Want to talk to you about^^f and her comment, too... 

stupid comment, and whether you want me to say 
anything to her 
What would you say? 

So, it looks like there is a networking/break starting at 2, then kerry 
sleeper from 2:15 to 2:45, then homicide trends at 2:45-3:15, then 
another networking/break. I would schedule for 2:00. 

Then 3:30 is Oregon standoff/managing relationships. 

Just reinforce that you're good people, experienced, credible. Not 
"little" anything. Not sure it would make a difference but willing to. 

I'd be more interested in finding out why she said it. "What was up 
with little counsel girl? Do you not like her?"_

Toscas showed up. Just like Thurs meeting, he was by far the most 
aggressive DoJ in the room. Literally siding with us and fighting 
back againstet al's concerns. \U0001f621\n\nl literally 
said, twice, stop framing your facts to them simply in terms of PC 
for an affidavit. Frame your argument in terms of what is most 
compelling in the big picture to achieve what we want, then 
narrow down to show how it links specifically to our case/pc/etc. 
\n\nl think George got it, but jeez. It's not so hard, is it? 

It's not. They're just not very good. Can you call George, ask him to 

attend? _ 

\U0001f60a D. \n\nHe's not. Already thought to myself, Jesus 
George, why can't you have this conversation. He got immediately 
what I was saying (granted, he may already have had the benefit of 
Andy telling him). It's a smart play. It's not complicated. 

Will have to tell vou mv convo with earlier and what MU 


Will have to tell you my convo with earlier and what^g 

said. After I left, he apparently said he was "tired of taking sh*t 

from the Bureau." \U0001f612 _ 

Gotta go have career counseling with Bill...should be done before 
you get there, though. 

Taking sht from the Bureau?! Poor^^^J It's so hard to be him. 

Especially gratifying that Toscas then tells him exactly the same 
thing 

How'd the talk go with Bill? What'd he say? 


In any event, he said he thought the world of me and couldn't 
imagine me being anywhere other than the top quadrant.

Fie didnt, directly. Certainly didn't say no way, but nor did he say, "I 
think you'll be able to do that." Two reasons, at least. Much easier 
for him to argue to advance me if he can say "Pete's willing to go 
to the east coast" or even mid-atlantic than it is to say "Pete's 

limited to HQ and WFO." _ 

Second reason is he went to NY and left his family here. 

Always better to 
at least say "look. I'm open to the needs of the Bureau, just be 
aware of these factors" rather than "I must stay here" 

Especially if you do a 
gig as dad first. Or be like andy and be willing to not ever be 
promoted further because of your geographic limitations. 

I did tell him I'd be interested in being a DAD, he said good, some 
people aren't interested in that. I did caveat that later to CD by 
saying if Jones or Gordon left. I suppose I'd think hard about CYD or 
Crim or even CTD. Not Intel or other divisions.

Body _ 

Not gonna be charged isn't anyone at the fbi, that's for sure 


I might disagree slightly 


Okay. Not anyone informed at the fbi. 



Ha re your first 1026 


Also, Andy's conference room is too big. Way too big.^ • 
J|\n\nLeave the monitor wall in place. Too expensive to change. 
Move where he was sitting 15-20 closer to the screens. Liberate 
the remaining space. \n\nlt's too big. \n\nAnd it may be $$, but it's 
ridiculously too big.£^^^jj^| 

No way to change the room. The table alone was^H. (You can't 
repeat that!) No, instead it just means we now have to get a small 
conference table for his actual office, so that he can actually have a 

meet ing that is intimate. _ 

Does^H go to all the wraps, or was he sitting in for Eric? 

Sitting in for Eric now. 


Eric essentially done? 


And yes, re the room. But^H an idiot.

I'll ask you, in front of the D, "Pete, I apologize for putting you on 
the spot, but I know you shared with andy some of the comments 
you've been hearing from folks, I think it would be valuable for the 

D to know them." _ 

Can't right now but will shortly. 

Np. Have some time on all this. 

And hey^^^ call the field office. HQ isn't going to be able to 
draft a damn search warrant, the field is. Call an ausa on duty for 

chrissake. _ 

No kidding...but he never knew shit about the Bu anyway 

Talked to Bill just now 

Think I'm going to call Laufman this morning. Want details 
specifically on WHO is making these calls. Then call^f and talk 

about what they did in PC investigation land. _ 

Good plan. 

Don't let that pompous boob push you around either. 

I won't - he hasn't really tried to do that. He's largely absent. 

Work call? 

(Me with you, now? ( 

Just got done talking to Bill 

check out the wp articles I emailed. 

Read a Clinton one. 


When is Andy out next?

Funny to watch and think of 

No wonder he's a brusque as he is...and those 

Roma nians aren't e ven the gypsies... _ 

Seriously, I kind of hate them. (I'm sure^^J fine). But they have 
the crookedness of the Russians with the entitledness of the 
Italians. Yuck. 


Ha. Never really dealt with them 


Hey, work related, with Bill out, does Andy want Jones bringing 
MYE daily bullets? Or email from us to I don't see 

how we don't include him. And I think I def bootleg you in case he 

Fs it up _ 

I'm sure he doesn't care, plus I can't imagine that Jones will sit in 


I guess. Another thing to add to the to do list. 


Don't have anything until my 


910 mye staff meeting. 


Walking to desk 

I'm at my desk, hiding behind the yellow "away" light 

Jon got an eras machine last week. Wondering if I want to do the 

same. \U0001f615 _ 

When are you free tomorrow Ito talk with Jon about speech? 1? 

Not sure. Will let you know, 

And talkedto^^^^Barmer evening. \n\nConcluded by saying I 
cannot overstate to you the sense of urgency about wanting to 
logically and effectively conclude this investigation. 

Meet with Jon at 2 tomorrow? 

We have Bowdich at 2:30. Can you do earlier? Or any time after 
3:45. And/or come to Bowdich with us 
Don't want to do that. Let me look. 

I could do 1:30-2:30. Do you guys need to prep for that at all? 

Wait but you both have your 1:00.

Want me to come straight there? 

Hey need to go meet with NCOS on the uco stuff. 

Updates for you 

Will be in my office (just above you, I think) - sending a UC to 1:00 
so I have a bit more flexibility 
Hi.^H coming through 

With what? 

Sitting in CES with them overnight writing the PSEU form so it's 
ready tomorrow morning for Dana and George to sign. Dana is 

ready. _ 

Good. F-ing finally. 

Holy cow are you still talking?! 

Just finished. Will call. On the way out Eric asked (he suggested no) 

if we needed the meeting tomorrow afternoon 

Did you ask Andy if he still wanted to meet tomorrow? 

I did not. I had left when Eric caught me. I told Eric I deferred to 
Andy about whether or not we needed to meet. We did not talk 
about what we planned to tell the D on Mon. 

Spoke and relayed Andy's message. Told him Andy was 

relaying to Carlin. Richard said he'd wait to hear from on high. 

Carlin and George are definitely going to have to message down 

Can I send that to Andy. 

Think I need an eras.... 

And just got a mtg cancel for mtg tomorrow afternoon with Andy 

Remind story 

Yup. And Eric cancelling eve mtg too. 

Tried tonight but didn't reach him. Will try in am. 

Hey forgot to ask if you mentioned the whole special counsel thing 
to andy?

I walked through my convo with DoJ. Got more info ffomU 
about Laufman. It's a problem. Told Andy that, too. 

What info? 

Who was your poc to get an eras? Or did you just get JG's? 

I did just get^| I wonder what they asked him when he went to 

turn in his property. Just ask jon, no? _ 

Yeah, that's what I'm going to do. 

Talked to^^^f last night, btw. Fie spoke to^J. Shockingly, she 
did not sound surprised about the subpoenas, said she would 

accept service. \U0001f612 _ 

Still saying no about the laptops, but focused on Mills'. Fie said 
they were moving forward on that front as well. Helpfully, 
obliquely told/reminded her pet her prior conments that if she was 
going to call anyone, to do that soon. \U0001f612 Because we're 

just TFIAT bad. _ 

Of, not pet 


Your calendar isn't SO bad today....Jones has his meeting 

scheduled over Eric's farewell. Are you going to that? _

I'm thinking about not going with Andy tomorrow, going into to 
work but only working on uco policy and house stuff. I'm very torn. 

\U0001f612 _ 

You should definitely go before Andy 
leaves. You'll have another chance, but the irons hot now. Flip side, 

I really want you (and him, but at least one of you) at D brief. 

Work-wise, probably smarter to go in, I guess. 

Take the helicopter next time.;) 

Yes. ^ just texted. Dd flying with the DAG on the bird. So he'll be 
back for mye. So if there are extra seats. I'll join, if not. I'll come in. 

That's totally cool. 

Where do you leave from, Reagan? 

Troop configuration sits 11 (if you're taking the Blackhawk) but no 
idea how configured. 8, no problem. Take out seats and you can 
cram about 20 all soothed together (but that's SUPER tight). Is^ 

going?_ 

Scootched not soothed. It is NOT soothed. 

First time in a blackhawk? Flelicopter? 

Never been in a blackhawk, or any helicopter at all KalSpMSSiiil 


Well, I really hope you can go. There's got to be enough room - 
even if the DAG takes +2, +2 detail guys, and Andy, that's only 6. 

When will you know? _ 

Tonight? Not sure 

Saw your email. Waiting to do something until I get it "officially" - 
or can I use your email for that? We're going to have to go to NSD. 

I think Bill calling George is the right place to start, then I can 

follow up with 

Wait. Bill said cd will take the lead. 

Sigh. I suppose he'll relay that eventually. \U0001f612 
Fie will.

And I'm going to ping Jim R tomorrow (or whenever I get it) to say 
hey, per D's request, we've put quite a bit of thought into it, 
including coming up with this, Andy noted you were collecting 

comments, how would you like them. _ 

Well, he hasn't. I'm just going to email him and see if he wants an 
update from last week either tonight or tomorrow morning before 

he goes upstairs. _ 

I'm over my email limit so can't send right now. It's utterly freezing 

outside. Sucks. _ _ 

DAG detail saying only room for Andy. ^ is checking with her 
staff. 

Oof. That sucks. And bullsh*t, unless it's a smaller helicopter. Is it 
DOJ's or ours? If you cant go. I'll take you to lunch and make 
helicopter noises. ;)\n\nl just did a mass cull down on 324mail. 

Talking to Bill at 7:45. Did some open source 

research, no way we get that data on our own. _ 

I know. It has to be nsd. 

I need some clarifying data - just retention, right? While it might be 
helpful to put in Petraeus, Hitselberger, that's only to show they 
are different, ie, involve transmittal to another person. He just 
wants fact patterns where it was only retention, not disclosure, 
right? And taking graviman literally, list will not include more 
serious cases/disclosures which are more than retention. 

Yes, that's what I would say. 


Just finished with Bill 


Talked to 


Bill for about an hour. He mentioned email, said he would send 
(though he hasn't yet). He had a slightly different take than I did 
but we'll get there. His primary concern is asking DoJ in such a way 
that they respond straight to the D (which I can see happening) 
without us getting a chance to review for accuracy / spin. 

Insist it go through the DD. Then I'll give it to you. 

Well I think we start by trying to insist it go thru CD. We'll see. I just 
envision them being whiny about it unless they have something 

already written. _ 

They won't. I guarantee it.

Hope springs eternal. I suppose I could ask 


on the DL 


And yes, obviously I agree about it going thru cd first. Was just 
saying if they balk, there's no way rybicki wouldn't insist on it 

coming to us first. _ 

Is that something doj would ordinarily keep good records of? Or 

will this be a lift? _ _ 

If there are so few that someone like^H would literally be able to 
recall them then you have much bigger problems. 


Description might be hard. But I guess we'll see. 

The fbi can come up with description 
20 years is a long time... 

I'd like to make a suggestion though. I DO NOT think you should 
ask^^^J. I think Bill should ask George. is just going to 

bitch and moan. George sees the d three times a week. He is not 

going to say no. _ 

They won't be able to do that. No way. But let THEM come back to 

rybicki about what they can or can't do. _ 

Fine but then George tasks them and they ask me...when am I 
supposed to mention it? Seeing as how I own this program and all. 

Pete. I'm trying to save you some crap from them. Don't get your 
back up about it. When they ask you, you talk about it. What's the 
big deal? All they are going to do when you tell them is wait to 
hear from on high. So all I'm saying is start there. 

Look, I totally get what you're saying and agree with you. Just 

trying to figure out how best to own my program _ 

Ha. \U0001f60a See, my back's not up. Just trying to find the best 
way to play this. 

With this one, coming from the d, just let it trickle down from 
higher. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if George hears it from andy in 

the morning. _ 

Sounds smart 


Haven't heard from|

Just you 

J 

Yes just me with Bill 
I'm sure it's all good. 

I'm guessing some combination of the economic Espionage cases 
on 60 Minutes and tc 

Yeah, that makes sense. I'm glad he has you. And that he knows 

how lucky he is that he does. _ 

I'm also frustrated that I have to spend three and a half hours in a 
trp session for things that are already decided. We waste too much 
time on this process. It's important to do, but not this long, and not 
this c omplicated. _ 

HHl| I am so mad at^^^J right now. He's claiming 
reimbursement for car for 14-28 April (Conf authorized 18-22), 
lodging in Auckland 16-17 (Conf was in Wellington), m&IE in 
Auckland 14-16.\n\nl mean wtf. Have some sense, man. 

Do Not Let Him! 

That's really outrageous. 

I'm not going to. I've got to call him today. Since he didn't get 
business, he's entitled to a delay in route of one night, 3/4 days 
M&IE on each day. I'll let him explain that to me, though. \n\nThe 
rental car, no.\n\nOh, this was all in conjunction with his wife. 
Didn't use Carlson, "Contacted Carlson and determined there is no 
contract carrier to Nz. Due to this fact, and to ensure my wife could 
travel with me at am acceptable cost, I booked through other 

means." _ _ _ i 

In defense of his airfare, what he paid is much less than the Carlson 
fare. 

I DO NOT WANT TO ATTEND THIS\n\nGrump grump grump 

You already leave? \n\nAlso, need to to let me in toH| 
office 

can only do 4 or any time later. You want to try for 430, 

recognizing you have wrap at 5, or keep at 4? _ 

Give me a call when you're done, I am in hell 

Andy headed up. Told him you sat in conference call 

I made wrong decision on which meeting to attend. Read in was 
HORRIBLE.

Hey sent you some email going around this morning. Don't know if 
you noted one of them from last night, ^ said never 

responded to his email for update. We're talking in an hour, I'm 
going to encourage him to speak to Andy and about it, that 

it's undermining his position and effectiveness (to Andy) and that 
it's unprofessional (to^^^f). Obvious problem is its not easy for 
anyj to say that to the DD, nor personality. \n\nThe best 

way may simply be for him to say to Andy, you know, 1 contacted 
to follow up on the D's request and he didn't so much as 
send me an email, even to tell me he was going to talk to you. Let 
Andy infer the right leadership action / response.

Is Andy out at all next week? 

(le, not this coming week, the one after. 

Not that I'm aware of. 

Can you power up eras now amd work until 
physically need to be in? 

It's all on the unclassified side. \U0001f612 


? Or you 


You can eras that, too. But not your work desktop/hard drive 

Yeah, it's documents for Andy's prep today that I need to edit. 

Yay. Andy just asked me to sit in on the 2:00. 

And feel free to forward to Andy if you haven't already. Enough 

time passed... _ 

I'm fortunate to work with you. \U0001f636 

Bill did send them at 7:04. Andy sent them to me at the same time 

I sent them to him . _ _ 

Jjust said that on the npr news bulletin tonight at like 5:00 that 
they reported that the fbi investigation into Clinton was almost 
completed. He doesn't remember the sourcing. Found it very 

curious given the timing of today. Just fyi. _ 

Yeah saw that on a couple of Google News hits. Will go check it 
out. God I hope they're right. \n\nProbably going to pull the plug 

on my going to NQLA...\U0001f61e _

Bill said he was going to tell Andy today that everything went well, 
and that he'll provide him more info on Tues. Bill said you should 
feel free to talk about it if you want (after you and I talk about it -1 
framed it as we were going to talk later today).\n\nSo I'd wait at

him, he throws off his helmet and charges the mounds." 

Bottom line in their first counter offer DOJ is giving up a ton. I said 
fine, we can live with this, but this is about the most we can live 
with. So if you expect an extended back and forth with^^J don't 

give so much right out of the gate. _ 

In with Andy now. 

Cool. Just sent you email you should note to him. My (and his) 

recollection was right;) _ 

Hey Bill is here in my office, talking about WSJ thing 

Kortan just came in. I have more. I'll call you from the car. 

Ok. Anything to pass to Bill now, or that he should call andy? He 
thinks we should play for time. 

Yup. Why? You mean with andy? 

Nope. Me and you. \n\nBut yes, I wanted to ask later about with 

Andy _ 

Btw, Andy said let's hold in finding out the answer for now. 

I want to know, have been talking about it with jon for a couple of 
days. You think I should wait? I don't know what we could do with 
it, but it seems like an opportunit

Anything interesting out of convo you couldn't or didnt want to 

share in front of Bill? _ 

(Perfectly fine if not, just following up before everything is OBE 
tomorrow) 

Amd did you see request to move meeting up 30 minutes? I 

kind of like 10-1130 but I think I can... _ 

No, nothing additional. That was everything. 

I can too. Np. 

And man, EVERYONE'S angry. WF doesn't want to give people back 
for filt er, radio silence from DoJ,^^J angry about the consent 

jetter^_ 

Yikes! Have a meeting with D at 11 because apparently I'm the only 

one read in to a program (nfi) _ 

How can you be going to brief on something for which you have 

nfi? _ 

Call her now tell her andy is calling please. 

Just talked to her she is at her desk - not cell - waiting for the call 

He called trisha instead -1 gave him both numbers. Don't know 
wha t came of the c onvo. 

Ew.^^^ better prepared 

I talked with Bill; he had spoken with Andy but Andy had not yet 

tried to re ach out for Jim _ 

Does^| know?!?!? I told her to wait...\U0001f61e 

I know, I tried. But in case she was in the metro or something I 

wanted him to be able to reach s omeone else. _ 

She does. She should be calling you for^^^^ cell number. 

And god it's really infuriating that^J doesn't answer his phone. 

The goddamn Deputy is trying to reach his| and can't! 

Hey I just talked to her 

Apparently a bunch of emails going arouns 

Yup just sent to you. 

She said JB hadn't responded and wondered if she should send to 
Andy or wait for her chain to. I told her to respond direct to Andy

All great topics. The climate surveys are an annual kick in the balls.

Sorry was in sioc can talk now 

Check vm please. Andy called. Program just started so I can only 
text 

Yes otd is ready. \n\nD is the one who asked how early we could 
talk tentative scheduling. D asked if we could do that now (at date 
of last brief). I said I thought we should wait until we had laptops in 
hand. D said, I think that's right. Thats what I was going off of 

Okay, let me text andy. 

That occurred at beginning of brief, he wasn't there

Yes, he knew that. That's why he called. I just asked him whether 
he wants to wait until we actually have eyes on docs. 

Also, what I discussed with^^H was don't discuss specific 
dates, but throw the willingness out there, tell if we find a 

lot of material on laptops we might need more time 

I just andy to call your cell if he has more qs. 

Andy said:\n\nl am inclined to wait for now. Let's get a peek at it 
first, see how long oyd thinks it will take to make sense of 

anything, etc. _ 

Just talked with him, all good 

K. Thanks 

Hey talked with him just now. Pis give me a holler when you're 
done, want to ensure he knows I'm not questioning what he wants 
to do, just explaining why we proposed reaching out 

Okay. It just started so it is going to be a while 

Np. I think we're good, but I just ran thru what D said. Agreed with 
Andy that smarter thing is to wait and see what's on there but 
likely no way we hit summer solstice if we do that. 

Funny, I'm sure it's perfectly fine but got that funny feeling telling 
the DD that the D said something different from him. Andy noted 
he told that we wouldn't schedule interview until laptops 

were reviewed and D didn't have that info, then said he'd take care 
of D.\n\nl just don't want him thinking that I felt he needed to 

explain himself to me. _ 

I really wouldn't worry about it, but yes, of course we can talk. 

I know you're right but still. Besides, I want to congratulate each 

other once we get these dammed things _ 

Also, funny, mentioned to Andy what was going on, Toscas had 
already updated him. \U0001f612 

I know you've heard me complain a thousand times, but that sh*t 

fromKILLS me _ 

The DD also calls you directly. This 
whole case is fucked up. It is what it is. 

Got the laptops :)

So I'm very torn. Email back to^^^^ on fbi net or unet? 

Unet for the email. Otd is done with phase 1 

Wow, that was quick 

Why unet? I was actually thinking fbi net so at least it can't be 

forwarded outside. _ 

Find anything in allocated space? 

Yeah. I think they underpromise because of the 10% of the time 
things go horribly badly. \n\nFair enough. You can eras it 

tomorrow and they can read on Mon... _ 

I'm on eras now. Just going to send it off and be done with it. 

Am typing it up on fbi net now. 

This gave me chills. I'm proud of these girls. Stupid f-ing 
bigots.\n\n2 Valedictorians in Texas Declare Undocumented 

Status, and Outrage Ensues http://nyti.ms/lWHYYYE _ 

You've got to read the article I sent. I'm infuriated. I f-ing hate 

people . _ ___ _ 

I started. And while i hate Trump, part of me thought 
would not/may not get into^J because they're white and not 

from buttf*ck Texas...H6362 _ 

I'm torn between their achievement and the reality of the 
limitations it places on others. All of that separate and distinct 
from the bigoted hatred of half (it seems ) of our population. 

Dude. THESE GIRLS ARE THE VALEDICTORIANS IN THEIR CLASS. 

AND ENGLISH IS THEIR SECOND LANGUAGE. AND THEY OVERCAME 

SERIOUS ODDS. THEY HAVE EARNED IT. _ 

Do you think Yale would be best served being entirely populated 
by smart upper income white boys? Come on.

I'm saying the difference between equal opportunity and equal 

outcome is hazier as you get closer. _ 

THESE GIRLS DIDN'T EVEN HAVE AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY! What 
are you talking about?! 

I'm not saying they didn't deserve it. I'm saying their background 
gave them an advantage the upper class white boy didn't get 

Is that fair? 

We're not talking about south Asians in the same socio-economic 

class. _ 

They earned it. But so did lots of others. 

And I'm not talking about these two. I'm talking about the pros and 
cons of considering anything other than merit for admission. 

No it f-ing did not. Their background gave them an advantage?! 
They grew up in a home, in all likelihood, where their parents were 
illiterate. Probably wholly uneducated. Undoubtedly poor. Yeah, 
those lucky girls who got to bubble in "Mexican." 

I get that would further slash minority representation. 

I'M TALKING ABOUT THESE TOO. 


Sorry, I'm really mad. 

And you ARE talking about these two. You said their background 
gave them an advantage that upper white kids didn't get and that 

is completely BULLSHIT. _ 

Yes, their background did. They deserve to go, as do thousands of 
others 



If they were the valedictorian and we undocumented and had the 
same story, I dare say they'd be going the same damn place. 


That is bs. And I agree with that. That is fake diversity, and we both 
know that. Don't you dare lump these girls, who on top of 
everything else, had the courage to state that they were 
undocumented, in with^^H kid.

These two are being held up because of the broader issue. Distill 
the calculus, and the argument. What is the value of diversity such 
that we can measure it against other qualifications? Like being

And yeah, the no win of the narrative. 

Hi. I may go insane editing this. You simply cannot edit with 12 
people. 

****Also, remind me to tell you to flag for Andy^^J emails we 
(actually ICIG) found that have portion marks (C) on a couple of 
paras. DoJ was Very Concerned about this, willing to bet they will 

tell George _ 

Found on the laptops? 

No. Found on the 30k provided to State originally. 

No one noticed. And while minor, it cuts against "I never send or 
received anything marked classified" 

So why would they tell George? 

Which may or may not be a big deal, but it is notable. Easier to 
explain on Lync or in person, \n\nl will put on bullets tonight, 

which I am sending to you _ 

Because they're worried, holy cow, if the fbi missed this, what else 

was missed? _ 

Which I get, because I had the same worry. \n\nAnd they like 
snitching to George 

Just dropped off your uco print job \U0001f636 
Oh jesus. Have something to tell you. Will call after wrap.

I told him I had to get confirmation from 7th floor

Just relayed to I 


I, he's calling Toscas 


Yup. Toscas literally just called. Andy couldn't talk, so we will 
discuss soon. 

Hey do you anticipate mye due-outs tonight? I think I'm going to 

get out of here. _ 

No. I hope to be leaving in 10-15 minutes. Andy on with toscas 
now. 

Arghh! Ok I'll wait...\n\nAnd thanks 
Don't! Truly. 

15 minutes is easy...\U0001f636 
Okay, will call you in 5. 

K.\n\u263a 

And ha, Bill called right after we talked. I guess it's good to answer 
your phone when the boss calls at 8 ... 

Put a hard copy of the report in your center desk drawer 

Set up a conference call so you can dial in as we take care of 
errands...\U0001f636

And hey, 3) I have an answer for interview location. Brilliant. (Jon 

thought of it). Completely handles the issue. _ 

On September 13, 2007, Martin appeared on Comedy Central's The 
Colbert Report to discuss Mother Teresa's fifty-year sense of 
abandonment by God which had much coverage in the media at 
the time. Martin appeared several more times on The Colbert 
Report, once to discuss Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the U.S. in 
April, 2008,[8] and again on February 23, 2009 to discuss how 
poverty (or, at least, reducing the importance one places on 
material goods) can bring one closer to God.[9]\n\nOn March 18, 
2010, Martin was invited to the program in the wake of Glenn 
Beck's suggesting that Catholics run away from priests who preach 
"social justice."[10] Martin noted that "social justice addresses the 
things that keep people poor" and "asks you why are these people 
poor." He added that "Christ asked us to work with the poor.... In 
the Gospel of Matthew He says that the way that we're going to be 
judged at the end of our lives is not what church we prayed in or 
how we prayed but really ... how we treated the poor."

Yikes. 


Yeah not a big deal - was supposed to in PDB today but will run 
tomorrow. Info is not time sensitive. I think it was more (all 
allegedly according to our PDB people, who may be dramatic) that 
she didn't get her question answered before the follow on briefing. 

ambushed me...\U0001f612\n\nWill call when out 

Much better numbers for you :D 

Hey see email. Can you call me? Q which will have to go to Andy 

Now we're talking about Clinton, and how a lot of people are 
holding their breath, hoping. 

DID YOU TELL HIM THAT YOU ARE THE LEAD ON THAT CASE?! 


Andy just called me with a question that I should remember from 
my doj days and don't. Makes me frustrated. Will need to look it 

up tonight. _ 

Just can't remember what kind of contact is permissible once a 
subject has lawyered up pre-charges. I know an ausa can't contact, 
but I thought a source still could. Usao and doj are saying no, and I 

seriously can't remember. _ 

But hasn't been charged? I think we have much more latitude than 
attys do, provided we don't coordinate (which I think triggers 
McDade stuff). But I'm far less an authority than you. I do think we 
can use sources, though. Call a good cdc, they'll know. Sadly I can't 

p oint y ou to one ajt^f_ 

Yes, that's my recollection, but I just don't remember. 

Oh god yes. No good can come of that. Your dad know you're 
heading up the case yet? 

Well you may not come back if they go 

video route, right? 

Video, no. I just doubt that is going to happen. 

I hope not (re video). But it's clear that's how JR is pushing 

Andy's not. That's got to be equal sway, at the very least. 

Nor Bowdich. Nor pretty much anyone else as best I can tell. Thats 
got to count for something.

And still, i don't think doj has the nerve - or that it ultimately serves 
their interests - to tell him he cant, or even that he shouldn't, do it. 

I agree. But those couple of hours to takes to set it up could be 

EXTREMELY awkward. _ 

Yeah, but you know that doesn't really matter. They'll call rybicki, 

or andy. _ 

Can't enter after midnight, you mean? 

And they say, sorry, he hasn't said, exactly. We'll pass a message to 

him b _ 

Yes re entrance 

Not credible. Surely even if opa doesn't say what it's about, it will 

be obvious. _ 

And so what are they gonna do? 

Everyone over there says, "we left a message. Sounds like it's 

about.." _ 

Doj will be fine. They'll huff and puff but ultimately what are they 
going to do? Truly. In 4 hours? They can barely assemble a 

conference call in that time. . _ 

Announce at 11 and you lose and hour and a half to lunch time 

confusion anyway. It'll be Ok... _ 

They can tell the D no. And he really wants to avoid straight up 
insubordination if he can... 

Florida has a different rule re represented parties. It is really bad 

for us. _ 

Oh. What was the answer? All this based on bar rules 

Yup. Pretty much as soon as we tell usao, we are prohibited from 
making any contact. Terrible disincentive to not talk to your usao. 

Funny how it all comes down to state bar rules. Seems very 
capricious, like there should be some supremacy clause to get us 

out of it... _ 

And damn...a mess that made its way up to DD level? 

It didn't apply to us, until dumas congress passed mcdade. 

Yes. Big implications for the continues investigation against 

Yep, well, maybe this is the chance for a legislative fix. More 
important than half assed gun sale notification....

I know it is. Its why i LOATHE congress. Can't wait to hear the story. 

Hey can I put what you told me about the Privacy Act mtg in the 
nightly bullets to Bill, including her going to beginning of next D 
brief? Will not provide detail other than to say mtg occurred today. 

You're kidding about the Giacalone article, right? 


Oh. Christ. I thought I had another problem to deal with. 

If course I want to hear nsd screw-job story. Also relay mtg at fed 
programs,thinks it's g oing to have to gcrto dag 

And instead I'm busting my butt trying to fight stupid 
legislation. 

Which isn't going to pass! That's the silly thing - OCA and OLA 
ought to be able to say, give this some effort so everyone knows 
where we stand, but understand it won't pass, so don't stress too 
much about it b

And you should ask^| about Harbach soon before it is too late 

and he ne ver speaks to you again._ 

I'll ask U, though funny thing is I think he will be ok with it, just 
like he was the Mills preamble. Because both this and that are 

reasonable and help the cause _ 

Meanwhile I'm sitting here spinning in my head about the case. 
Angry at myself for not thinking about raising Judiciary and Intel 
committees. I have in the past, but the time to do it was yesterday. 
Clearly the man is, though. Just feels like I dropped the ball. 

And the more I think of it, no way the D or DD should call ICIG. 

Delegate that to Bill. _ 

Remember at the beginning of the case, Randy was delegating 
contact with him to^^f and Jon... 

That's great advice but they all kind of tumble around in there 
together, inseparable. \U0001f615\n\nThe interview needs 
tweaking, the 302s need a fine edit, the summaries need to be 
written, I need to see what I did wrong or forgot or put off and not 
do that again and I need to do background for the job application, 
combination of I'm perfect for the job and not good enough and 

not going to get it and and and. _ 

You're probably not going to get it. But that's not because you're 
not good enough. That's because of the egos of other people in our 
organization. So we'll try the best we can, and know that you'll get 

it eventually. _ 

I'll be retired, eventually. Certainly well before I get to AD, if I have 
to spend the time in each job that miraculously doesn't apply to 
the chosen few. But I need my CT club card to do that. 


In fairness, you've been a SC for four months. We'll do our 
research, but I think you're going to be hard pressed to find even a 

CT SC who was promoted that quickly. _ 

I will have completed five months by next weekend and be into my 

6th month _ 

Grumble grumble grumble. Look. I'm responsible for all the career 
choices I've made. And as you've pointed out, I wouldn't change 
them.^^^^^^^l for making me understand and own and see 
that as a positive, \n\nl just get really angry and dispirited at seeing 
less (frequently MUCH less) competent leadership advance. Case in 
point: who's my new boss? Who are all these great SACs with Cl 
backgrounds? 

Ok I'm done. I'll put in for jobs I want and work hard and well no 
matter what happens.

And dang it, I'm hoping to catch Rybicki to throw out the Q. of 
watching, caveated with the acknowledgment of complete 
undertaking of the million reasons the answer may be "no," alas, 

[without success. _ 

Did you end up telling Andy about what I told you about the 
j stuff, or did Bill broach it? 


\UQ001f6121. _ 

All his DADs and SCs sat there staring at their hands. ...someone 
asked him why the change, he said that was for him to know.... 


Bill talked to him about it last night, i talked, to andy about it today 
again. He is going to broach it with DAG extra week, but he wants 
CD and CyD to have a plan for review. 


Any intrigue on the MYE front? \n\nAnd damn it's going to be 

miserable to have you away for a 

week.\U0001f636\U0001f636\U0001f636\U0001f636 


No, didn’t talk about mye except for if I saw the lynch articles. 


Going in to wrap with Bill. This ought to be interesting. 



INBOX 

Oof. Hi. Sounds like a comparatively reduced - stress day, though.

you. Have to write something with Jon and low, let me know

free to talk.

Did you read the nyt write up this morning? \n\nThe interview had 
been weeks in the making as law enforcement officials and Mrs. 
Clinton\u2019s team coordinated schedules. Democrats also 
hoped that holding the interview on a holiday weekend might ease 
the anticipated storm.\n\nln a telephone interview with Chuck 
Todd on MSNBC after her meeting, Mrs. Clinton said, 
\u201cl\u2D19ve been eager to do it, and I was pleased to have 
the opportunity to assist the department in bringing its review to a 
conclusion.\u201d\n\nAccompanying Mrs. Clinton into the 
I meeting were her lawyer David E. Kendall; Cheryl D. Miils and 
!Heather 5amueIson, longtime aides who are also lawyers; and two 
lawyers from Mr. Kendall\u2019s firm, Williams & Connolly, 
Katherine Turner and Amy Saharia.\n\nEight officials from the 
1F.B.I. and the Department of Justice conducted the interview, 
‘according to a person who was familiar with the substance of the 
session but declined to be named because the meeting was 
private. This person characterized the meeting as

Eight, because Peking DoJ is ridiculous. What I didn't say in the 
conference call is that and comments were largely 

unnecessary... _ 

Mrs. Clinton had no public events scheduled on Saturday, but after

Clinton, went to New York and saw the Broadway show

changing given all the practice that like happened yesterday. I told 
him he could always bounce off of Andy or JR to get their thoughts. 



But HUGE day.

I'm so sorry \n\nUnrelated, you're going to need to tell me to be a 
little bit less of a control freak about the case. It’s out, there are a 
hundred people doing things, and I'm not going to be able (or 

need) to mana ge all of it and ensure its right.... _:_ 

Actually the case is over. So it's not yours to control 
a nym ore._ 


Yes. I need you to say things like that, \u263a 
You have time for a quick work call? 


God I hate Congress. So utterly worthless. 
Less than worthless. Contemptible.

you think it went? Andy seemed a little p*ssed/short on time. His 
"let Stephen finish" to me worried me a bit except he d id it to J B 
and a bunch of other people, too.\n2) in the wildly unlikely event 1 
have to testify (and tell me I'm right about that -1 think it's unlikely 
and even less likely I'd go outside of a group). I'm leaning on you to 
prep the hell out of me.

I'm sending to my 830...\U0001f612 

I'm talking to about American exceptionalism right now. 

Pretty strongly in favor. As I said to doesn't mean we're perfect or 
do everything right, but as a system of government, country of 
laws, I think we're pretty damn great. 


But there's a difference between that and exceptionalism. Just look 
at the word. It implies not only that we're great, but that you suck. 
And that we are better and you should change to be like us. It goes 
hand in hand with American arrogancism 


1 know. I get that. I'm using the term loosely, not in the political 

philo soph y way. ___

Really upset that he would join the call? I get it.:( 


Yes. And even more at and what she thought was utterly

Are you going by yourself or planning to take others? 


No, I told lim, me, just our leadership. Her group is 
apparently too big to fit into a car. \U0001f612__ 


If Jon says keep it, I will take and defer to Jon if he wants me to 
take one of his guys. \n\nBut when we spoke earlier, he wanted 
me to p ostpone it _ 


Yes Peter. That is my point. She has a whole team, all you need is 
yours elf._ 


No, damnit, that's not it. I don't want to wait longer. 


What I don't like about their behavior is knowing we were only 
bringing leadership, they can't bring three to us?

and also ensure that no one on their side says anything sensitivr

Hey 1 ran into Bill, he wants to keep the brief smaller. His point 
(which I hadn't thought of) is Andy is more likely to share his 
internal thinking in front of a smaller group of people he knows 
rather than a larger group. Plus, fysa/atmospherics, Bill noted "it's 
just so hard to get time with him." Whether true or not that's Bills 
perception. Thought you'd want to know

hear me in even those times and either don't need me to tell you 
what I'm telling you, feel like I'm asking you do do something about 
it, or both. \n\nAnd sometimes. I'm just looking for a little 
validation. Yes, the Andy - George dynamic did cause some 
problems. Yes, Jim in particular isn't always good at email distro. 
Thats all.\n\nAnyway, all of this probably better talked about it

Should I forward leak article to baker and rybicki?The Powell stuff 

was in her 302 an d Ihm, rig ht? Did we turn over his 302? _ 

Sure, but note that odd sourcing. It was in her 302; I'd want to 
double check if we turned over his 302, though I'm almost certain 
we did.\n\nAnd I'd bet the unnamed source is almost certainly 
Powell. _ 


I'm just going to forward your email, so the sourcing ref is in there. 


Sorry 1 have 20 minutes to get my shit together for dni 


Shouldn't take that log. Let me pull data, should take 10 minutes 


Good side effect of briefing this a million times.

Ooh god I love that answer :)\n\nReally well. He's calling D, I left 

me ssage for Rybicki. Will call you when I get back... _ 

Ok, I REALLY love that answer \U0001f636 

Why calling D? To say you guys are awesome? Get your thoughts?

Jon and I don't have the opportunity to input, where

My point is, that brief went super well. So even if you would have 
phrased a fee things differently, and even of you would have liked 
to have known every fact before hand, it was superbly. And you

Here we go:\nHarry Reid Cites Evidence of Russian Tampering in

Inquiry\n\nhttp://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/us/politics/har 

rv-reid-russia-tampering-election-fbi.html 


But Mr. Reid argued that the connections between some of Donald 
J. Trump\u2019s former and current advisers and the Russian 
leadership should, by itself, prompt an investigation. He referred 
indirectly in his letter to a speech given in Russia by one Trump 
adviser, Carter Page, a consultant and investor in the energy giant 
Gazprom, who criticized American sanctions policy toward 
Russia.\n\n\u201cTrump and his people keep saying the election is 
ngged,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cWhy is he saying that? Because 
people are telling him the election can be messed with.\u201d Mr. 
Trump\u2019s advisers say they are concerned that unnamed 
elites could rig the election for his opponent, Hillary Clinton.

me for Andy's late hours:\n\nGood deal. 1 also want to stay a little 
tighter in the future so we can ensure Unity of effort for both Andy

A) Pete, it's going to be fine. Don't make this something else to

me may be slightly different. 1 am part of that white male agent

working hard.

Yeah, think so. Maybe Saturday night. We'll see. 


If sets up the call the real test will be whether he sends 

me the call in info. I am angry, Pete. \U0001f621 _ 

Just ask Andy, no? The problem is no one on that call has 
knowledge of the case anywhere near you. Face was 

utterly absent for it. Not saying he shouldn't be there, but include 
Bill. And, obviouslv. vou. 


Oh, I'll get the info. I just have a feeling I'm going to be left off 
"accidentally." 


God, I'm really in a bad mood now.

INBOX 

And re my last. I'd add that at this point the questions at this point 
are organizational risk best answered by people with thoughtful 
smarts. And I'm not sure about the group on there, either. 


B) thing is, there are VERY inflammatory things in the 302s we 
didn't turn over to Congress (because they weren't relevant to 
understanding the focus of the investigation) that are going to 
come out in FOIA and absolutely inflame Congress. I'm sure Jim 
and Trisha and Dave and Mike are all considering how things like 
that play out as they talk amongst themselves.

I'll tell you. Just didn't feel like talking about it that time you 
brought it up 

B) and as they prep Jason. Who is going to be the first person they 
call. That settles it - I'm calling him, of at least giving you material 
so he's aware of it (which I GUARANTEE didn't come up yesterday). 


Want to imsg it to me, or want to do it in person? 


It's not that sensitive. 


Ok. You can imsg just for convenience of typing, too, if you want.

Certainly those. Probably others. All the laptops and media 
voluntarily turned over to us by the attorneys ("why didnt you ever 
serach this"? "Why isnt this relevant to our oversight 
responsibilities"?) 1 want to go read through the ones we didn’t 
produce. The point is Reps will try and spin and attack whatever is 
in the ones not initially turned over to them.

Oh well that's totally defendable. Why did they give them to

i Are you F*CKING KIDDING ME. A) That's pretty much the OPPOSITE 
of what was said yesterday. Kind of radically changes some of our 
thinking. B) Isn't it OCA's job to talk to OLA? 

Hey, let me know once you've read email. How substantively 

does it change what we want to to? Maybe not, if we want to avoid 
a fight on this. 


Trisha is going to be SO mad. Not only did Andy ask HER to 
reach out, but she even told Jason in an email to us that she had 

already reached out, but hadn't heard back yet. _ 

But no, I don't think it changes anything. 

he might work himself out of 
contention. I'm glad that my 6th sense of dude, I don't know that 
you know what you’re talking about/are wrong was working... 


Always with that guy. He just desperately wants to be in charge, in 

the know... ___ _ 

Talked with Bill 

Everything. He sounded like he thought I had called him, though he 

dialed me. Per haps he butt d ialed._ 

In any case, the week ahead. . He said Bowdich 

and Mike S aren't happy with it. Prep for Jason. His concern that 
we're throwing him up there, and the absence of an alternative.

Btw, talked with Bill at length about (in the context of 

going through what's going on). In a way that didn't burn any 
source, he said he hasn't had any coordination on this, that he 
never discussed (or wants) giving anything up, and that if anything, 
ITC efforts should be located within one Branch with CD and CYD 
and SecD. Said Steinbach also thought the same. Though of course 
he's out this week, all week.

Ran into Bill, he was trying to get a hold of Jim, who was in with his 
Deputies. Secretary offered to grab him but Bill said no 


He's calendared to go to the session board. Does he normally do 

that? _ 

Hey are you able to step out to grab the product we discussed with 

andy? They want it cleared tonight _ 

Hey I honestly did not know the specific reason for the concern, 
other than what I told you. Thats why 1 was answering as I did, to 

see if he'd provide more detail. _ 

It was a convo between him, Jim and Kortan.... 

You also left your update. Let me know when, I'll bring it up 
before you go. \U0001f636 


Hey I'm almost home, sorry. Remind me tomorrow what

Yeah, and 1 told you a grand total of 2 minutes after 1 learned it was

at this. LITERALLY EVERY OTHER SIGNIFICANT ARTICLE we've 
treated this way. And the article was out for half an hour. My 
sending it in no way points to you. \n\nThe fact that everyone is 
treating this so hush hush differently is part of the problem.

And it's above the fold. Jerks. 

I wonder how Devin got a hold of the story. I have theories. 

And I don’t want to waste time today on the stupid argument last 

And Devlin is saying, not implying there’s a connection here, but 
look at the timing - server, then meeting, then case, then funding. 
The point we need to highlight isn’t the March date of discovery of 
the server - because to us, who cares? - it’s the date anyone 
realized there was classified on there._

That we should have gone on the record saying Kallstrom and 
others are not credible (which may be valid), but then saying we 
could pull his tolls if we wanted to. Because she knows all about 
our policy regarding investigations of members of the media.

Yes. But she's an expert who knows everything. \n\nl'm telling you,

Leaking information about ongoing investigations. Which is 
incorrect information. By agents who don't know about things 
talking to him. \n\nSee? That's the thing. Her initial point, that we 
should have gone after the agents talking harder and sooner, is not 
unreasonable. But the subsequent discussion falls into uninformed 
assertions.

Maybe we should go to war with them, if they're spouting bile like 
Kallstrom. He's really out of bounds. That is a valid debate. Talking -

There's not a crime. So you publicly shame or disavow him. And 
you find out who's talking to him and go after them with opr. It's a

Oof. Which letter (s), (or tabs in the binder)? 



I'm going to meet with Andy at 5:30 about it.

Haven't met with andy yet. He is still in with the director. 

How long you think you'll be with him? (Rough guess - 30 min? 

Hour and a half?) _ 

Probably 45 minutes at least. 

Sorry. Was in with andy.

Awesome. 

Last night, I talked with Bill before leaving. Very first thing he did 
was show me a page of notes, bullets, he had written about 


Oh jeez. 

Bill is just not getting it. \U0001f612 


I think it's he can't get over his outrage at how bad it is. I said, Bill, 
we're not going to get anywhere trying to prove those things.

Had an hour long convo with Bill. Talked about the meeting (they 
had it at DoJ, Bill, Jim and Jon), expressed our frustration, Bill 
responded. \n\nTalked about and WFO SAC job, what I 

expected, and >aying which is fine, you know the 

conflicted way 1 feel about that but it is what it is. Mike said 
something super irritating to Bill, essentially, Pete briefs well but 
he needs more time to demonstrate his ability to manage. Bill 
said he thought that was just a fig leaf for saying out it 

aggravates me. I'm sorry, I'm not briefing what someone tells me, 
I'm briefing what I'm doing. And I'm managing (for the case) a ton 
of people in various divisions and multiple agencies and foreign 
governments. Not to menion the issues I've briefed you on and 
am managing for cd3, etc. \n\ni do think it's a fig leaf, but have 
the balls to say, Pete, you're doing a great job. Keep it up. Youve 
just gotten promoted, twice, and we need you as a DAD where 
you can do good: embrace that role. DON'T tell me, you brief well 
but you need to show me some more management skill. F you. 1 
manage my ass off every goddamn day in this sh*tstorm, and 
keep the branch running to boot.

It was OK. 1 told him we heard via / and that we were

that way broadly without giving any specifics, so he thinks it 
helped rather than hurt. Said we hadn't closed anything, and 
generally talked about our path forward. Said they didn't ask for 
an update when we got back, and that he thought we were in a 
good nlacp_

I know, but I told Bill I really needed him to determine whether or 
not I should even put in, and the message it sends either way. He 

said he would talk to Andy this week. _ 

It won't. Stop worrying. Trust me.\n\nlf you had more time as 
DAD under your belt, do you actually think would even 
stand a chance because of some bs claim that you need more 
proven leadership? Because that happened when you both were 
up for DAD? Come on. It's face-saving for pure and simple. 


The answer is no, Pete. 100% no. Andy will say the same. 


)f Thus came up in the context of bill asking about a 

for who deserves it, and Bill was told no. I assume

That's a different conversation, and one he can have not in this

All of that is correct. You just can't move having been DAD for

Even an SESer over a year doesn't change three month as DAD. 

It's not long enough in your current role. And christ, you're NEED 
in this role. Way more than you'd need to be as SAC. Just relax, 

It will come. I promise you. _ 

I'm not needed. I need to show I can effectively manage. 

\U00 01fG12_ 

Wish wouldn't have said anything about that, or called 
BS 

Cause this is going to sit in the back of my head like a festering 

pile of crap. _ 

Peter. In the immortal words of Jim Baker/Taylor Swift: Haters 

gonna h a te...shake it off, shake it off. \U0001f60a _ 

Don't let it. Do you respect 

And how did that guidance work for you?\n\nEnough. I thought at 
least we had a decent relationship he would say that sort of BS. I 

get his faults, but still. Just say the truth. _ 

He's too arrogant. He can't see the truth. 

I haven't worked closely with him enough to see that 


And maybe vaguely related, man I'm angry the way worked 

out. That article is horrible. _ 

Oh please. I'm calling BS on you respect him. I don't. What non- 
critical thing have you ever had to say about him?\n\nAnd yes, 

probably related. \U(J0Ulf512 _ 

A) I think he does a decent job advocating for CD in front of 

audiences like the SAC conference. _ 

Okay, great. Mad props to him then. \U0001f612 

A) fine. Look, I'm obviously cranky/stung/demotivated by it. 


Just talked with Jon for an hour. 


Back to being a little cranky with Bill about the meeting. Jon asked 
Bill on Thurs if it was still on. Bill told him to talk to him Fri AM. 

Jon said JB was really good at the mtg, kept saying, we don't know 
or we're not going to discuss that. He's obviously as worried as he 

was. _ 

Plus remind me stories of iod f'ing up visit with Andy and 

I can talk if you want. Have 10 minutes or so. 

I can't. Check email. 

Though I desperately want to \U0001f636

Yes! All mye matters.

I'm just angry about it. 

Me too. 

I fell into the same, what in the hell are you talking about Mike as 
POC mental trap \U0001f621_ 


Literally wondered if Andy had finally decided to delegate down 

management of George _ 

I kinda want to print these logs out and take them home :D 


No kidding. Will figure out a day to work late. 


Ok, I need to go back in with Bill. Jen and Dina still there. Call me 
later....particularly interested if D gave a fuller description of his 

convo^with Brennan_ 

Shocker, problems in ny. 

It you get done and have Bill and Jon tor a dump about last eve, 
please call me.... 

Sorry one sec. 

K. Talking with Bill about you, actually 


Hmmm. 

Just called your desk 

Was talking to bill. He is calling me back when he is done with 

you. _ 

Let me know what he says. I was surprised how hard he pushed 
me to think about it. The strength of my reaction to that is kinda 

confirming to me I don't want to. _ 

Oh god Susan Collis comments on npr.... 

said absolutely no question I have to be on the team. I'm so 

confused right now... _ 

Really?!?! 


As in, with her?

And that's what I wanted to talk about!!!!\n\nMy answer is no 

way, sac then AD and lead the Division _ 

And then I think.. 


A case which will be in the history books. A chapter - much like 
you tell me about my extra time in the field and all the cases 
("would you trade it"?). \n\nA million people sit in AD and staff 
jobs. This is a chance to DO. In maybe the most important case of 

our live s._ 

What did Andy say about going? 

No way dude. I really don't think you should do it.. 

You would obviously excel on the team, \n\nln a thousand ways 

they n eed someon e EXACTLY like you _ 

I don't really know what she meant when she said on the team. 
Full time, part time, I got home so our convo was cut short. 

Why? I don't understand what they need me for! Not when they 
have someone like Aaron. Or or 


And oaid some really outrageous complements to me. I just 

don't get what she even means. 


Ok I obviously want to hear what said 

I won't be able to repeat. Something about being the second 
smartest lawyer she has ever worked with besides comey. It can't 

b e true. _ 

And how I lean in and have a stronger work ethic than anyone she 

k nows. And more but I don't remember. _ _ 

You're in an entirely different class than or 



You see the future. You assimilate and combine things in am 
uncanny way. 


And re your attorney image of yourself, that's because you equate 
brilliant lawyer with or Trisha sitting in a room writing 

something as a clerk. \n\nREAL law is the application in a 
complex, dynamic environment. And you're astoundingly good at 
that 


Plus you have passion and curiosity, which is more than half of the 

battle anyway _^_ 

I am so not in a different class from and That is crazy. 

They don't get the big picture like you do is operationally 
amazing. But scaling law up rapidly and with agility is something 
that makes you special. THAT'S the mark of a brilliant mind. 

For me, and this case, I personally have a sense of unfinished 
business, \n\nl unleashed it with MYE. Now i need to fix it and 
finish it 


What does that even mean, scaling up

Is Andy truly accepting of the fact of the potential limitations that 
he may not be DD as long as he thought, and regardless, that we'll 
have a new D, as all this unfolds?\n\nBtw, Bill said he heard some 
guy in INSD was ranked #2 for the job. Someone we interviewed 
for a SC job in CD and turned down. Truly I don't know wtf is going 
on. Do I have cognitive dissonance? 

Look, here's the bottom line as best as I can sum up (and I hope 
you already know all this)\n\n-1 don't think Andy's acting in bad 
faith. I do think what he hypothetically proposes isn't something 
in his thought process or skillset or his available time and ability. 

In other words, when JG or Randy or even Bob said they had a 
plan, they had a PLAN. I don't think Andy does. And as A/D that's 
something too small for him to worry about. To put a fine point on 
it Wtf. Such a pin to the balloon of faith and confidence in 
the system, \n\n-1 knew my standing with Comey and Andy. One 
is gone, the other uncertain at best, \n\n-1 don't trust/believe in 
my standing with Daveand Carl and the rest of the EADs.\n\n-the 
SC is straightforward and rewarding, meaningful, honorable and a 
known quantity. It would cement my image as the "special project 
guy" or "glorified case agent" (nevermind they'll never see 
that way for doing the same job less well). I guess I’m 
feeling like I don't care about that right now. But it's not like i 
have a long time left. 

I understand all this. So what do you want me to say to him? Can I 
lay out this thinking, attributes to me?_: 


I don't know. \n\nMaybe i should sleep on it.\n\nMaybe, Pete's 
uncertain, between Comey the he's reassessing if he should 
just go?\n\nl don't know, Lis. 


We can talk in the morning. 


But I think that's a perfectly reasonable way to approach it. 

Thank you \U0001f636 

Sorry I don't have a ready answer here. I feel strongly - if 
ambiguously - at the same time I want to represent myself at the 
same time I don't want to be "that guy."\n\nNone of us are owed 
anything. Except when I think of the last 18 months. \n\nAnd then 
I think several of us ARE owed something. 


Hi. \n\nThe only additional thought I had is it's not tenable to 
have both me and :here. If he's in charge and I'm around, it 
undermines him (because Mueller and Aaron will be looking to 
me), it puts me in a horrible position, and it's a waste of Bureau 
resources. I told Bill that, but in don't know that will get up from

Yeah, 1 definitely plan to do that. 

I'm growing more doubtful about my role staying on. For the 
same reason you're not absolutely essential once 30 or 45 days is 
up, I'm not absolutely essential. You don't need someone to see 
around corners and check for pitfalls when you have the most all- 
star of all-star teams. I mean sure, might a catch a ball or two? 
Maybe. But not like the value I add at HQ when it's mostly not aII- 

slars._■ 

Thanks. Really curious to hear what he's thinking. 

I hear you. But a couple of things. First, I really truly believe you're 
not giving yourself enough credit for how good you are. Depends 
on what you want. At the Bu, you'll be a superstar amongst 
mostly not all-stars. There, you're a superstar amongst 
superstars.\n\nSecond, be really honest, what is your future at 
the Bureau? As long as Andy is A/D, you're in a weird place with JR 
and I don't know what his future is when a D is confirmed. 
Nor do I know Bakers future. 

And in terms of launching into the private sector, it's FAR 


On the flip side, I probably wouldn't want to be 
not with 


|Thi s is all true. But do I want this enough if my job is 





I honestlyjust don't see much of a role working for Bob/Aaron. 
They don't really need me. I'm happy to shag issues, but I don't 
really see that happening. Aaron doesn't give up much. 


That's definitely true re Aaron. I don't know if you'll be part of the 
true inner core, especially when they're fully staffed. Nor whoever 

the lead fbi person is. _ 

So then what am I doing there? Just padding my resume? 


Doing something meaningful, historic 


And yes, making contacts and superbly positioning yourself for 
whatever comes next 


Meh. Not if I'm the least impressive among the most impressive 
brains in America. 


Sorry was reading Carrie Johnson tweet and thread about Andrew 
being added to the team 


Send it please? He must have told her - they're close. 


Lisa. I don't think that's true. You won't be least impressive. You 
(and/or i, if I go) will solidly hold our own. Thats more than 
enough for you when it's all done. And that group will forever take 
take of itself. Look at the Enron crew._

Or you mean the daily 5s?\n\nlf it makes you feel any better, I've 
had no calls and no emails since Aaron yesterday at 530. 


The daily 5:00s. 


Oh. Have those started? 

I haven't heard anything about them. I was just going to show up. 

asked me where I substantively want to land on the team. I 
just don't know the answer. Maybe under Andrew on 

At least I know him. _ 

How did you find out? From him?\n\nThough I confess this is 

steering me fi rmly on to th e sta y th e cours e path. _ 

I'm guessing you haven't been invited because they don't want it 

to be if you leave. Yea, the y ha pp en every day. _ 

I'm at SC. Had a mtg with az, and at 1:30. 

Is "chief of staff" or "assistant to Aaron" tenable? \n\nAaron told 
me they were going to have them. Just hadn't heard they had 
started. 


Any agents around?\n\nl'm telling you, this may cement it for me. 

He asked to start coming to them at the end of our 

meeting._ 

Any indication to you about whether or not he wanted you there? 

In the ofc? No. But that doesn't mean. They're not working at hq. 

I'd do or If you can't do some 

leadership elemen t thing _ 

He certainly didn't tell me to start showing up, so I didn't ask. 


I still think it's ultimately OK for you even if you're on the bench. 

But you ego's gonna need some TLC. _ 

Yeah, tell me about it. \U0001f614 


Think of it this way - coming down off of DD staff to this is a HELL 
of a lot better than coming down to OGC somewhere.... 

But no doubt about it, it sucks. I can feel MY urge to want in, right 
now, even though I'm in some non-committed tdy limbo. 

How long are you staying? Will people be around if I stop by 
before the Valor game? (That'll impress the hell.out of them!) 

I'm at hq now, but JQ and AW are there. 

I wouldn't be there for another hour, plus I doubt my card works.

I worry they think I'm too loyal to Andy or Comey, won't truly 
trust me because of that. Maybe this will help. 


I dunno. 

I wouldn't worry about that 
Just be you 

That will be enough \U0001f60a\U0001f636 
It hasn't been yet. 


This is true. \n\nAnd I don't think it's that they don't trust you 
because of Andy or Comey. I think they just don't trust, generally. 

You will work your way in. Patience. _ 

And sigh. Ok. \n\nDon't worry too much about Mueller and 

Aaron. You're gong to be ok. :) _ 

Just talked to Jim for 40 minutes. He's a good man. He strongly 

thinks I shou ld go. _ 

He is an incredibly good man. 


So did you ever get an invite to tomorrow strategy mtg? And 
Aaron ever call you back?_ 


Yeah me too, re tired. \n\nAaron did call. Think it's still a little 
early for the strategy meeting, so will just do the ops update 

followed by the oca/OPA wrap _ 

I talked through what he'd envision were I to stay. I asked what 
my role would be, especially in terms of the leadership group. He 
thought i would be, but wanted to confirm with RM. 

Looks like all hands svtcon Tues and strategy meeting eitherTues 
or Wed. 

He ask you to stay for oca/ops wrap? 




Super.\n\nl'm glad for you at least. 


INBOX 


And morning meetings, but not tomorrow so he can run past RM. 

He said those have been largely admin in nature._ 

So you joining the team? I need to talk to if so. 


I don't know. 

I told him I wanted to be part of the leadership team if I stayed, 
because otherwise i didn't know if it would be worth it for 
me.\n\nl think we do 30 and try things on for size, which I guess 
was the plan an

Let's see what RM says first. If it's not going to work out, then no

My sense is ft will be. All of this is based on earned trust from 
competence, anyway. I'd have the advantage of being the senior 
bureau person, which also helps.\n\nl want to talk to you again, 
obviously. I was surprised how strong and unanimous both JB and 
Bill were. And if I do after all that, need to talk to Andy. 


I don't want to go to sleep, because if I do, then next thing I'll 

wake up and it will be time for work :( _ 

At least at a job in which you're wanted. 


Hi there. They do want you, Lisa. Just gotta figure your spot. 

Right 

You going to talk to Aaron about it? Or just dive in and see what 

o rganical ly develops? _ 

That's starting to seem a little pushy and desperate. 

Yeah I agree. So the latter, then. I'm tellingyou, you'll prove your 
worth a thousand times, quickly. \n\nGod there are like a million 
extra bird and nature sounds. Not sure what's up this morning..

I can't be there that early. And why would I? I am just going to 

drop them off. _; 

Sit there while he reads. Thats what I'm planning to do. 

\n\nllntil.he says, thanks, you can go.... _: 

He is not going to have you sit there. At best vou'l I be in your cube 
waiting for him to finish since they are and he 



And ha, I had NO idea about all that DOJ classified space 

restrictions. \n\nl'm going to have to research that... _ 

Dummy... 


We German tourists aren't always that savvy 

And who told Andrew about me? You? 

A long time ago, so he probably doesn't remember. I'd guess 

A aron. _ 

Ok now I'm not happy about the early morning doc delivery. 

\U0001f62a\U0001f629 _ 

Aaron was under the assumption that you are in at 7:45 anyway, 

did you not tell him that?_ 

That's sometimes aspirational, as you know. \U0001f60b 


Ha. So you've got no one to blame but yourself. \U0001f60a 


Double \U0001f60b 

Hey do you have stuff to discuss at the 9:40 as well? Az seemed to 
believe it was your meeting._ 


Ha. Not really but I'll come up with stuff. I said you had some 
items (which is why I cautioned you last night to save some for 

today) _ 

I didn't discuss any last night - but he thinks this is a you and he 
meeting and I had to mention that I would be there too. 

I specifically asked for the meeting in the context of you having 
items to talk about that we didn't get to. I went through my list, 
and we turn to the things you had, and I said I didn't know many 
of them, and that we should all sit down and meet. 


That's frustrating.

Andrew with him? _^_ 

Thanks, btw, for shagging that stuff for me with ) 

Yeah, though baker doesn't think that's the best place to land. 

Why? A specific case vs generalist idea? Or Andrew/that case? 

Aaron just told Dreeban we've set up a

You're going to follow up with re sf86 restrictions on use,

Yes. She just emailed that was not aware of any restriction 
other than before affirmative use we seek OPM approval since 

they own the info. _ 

And give JB credit, he's going through personnel issues and reach 
back into CD and FBI and the rest of it.\n\n(And i suspect I owe 
you some than ks fo r that \U0001f60a) 

And JB I think gave you a plug at the end 

Not following 

A plug for what? And to whom? 

A plug by JB about you to Aaron 

Oh. I didn't realize that personnel convo was with aaron, not just 
you. What's he say? 


Oh it was just JB and Aaron. I only heard part of Aaron's side 


Just Td you up for 702 education for the team (is it a 
problem/litigation issue, do we need to avoid searching against it, 
etc)

they're NY, in the same way Andrew worried about NY agents. 

And he had the sense to talk to me about what he wanted, and

Won't take long. 

Welcome to the club. \U0001f612 


What's the immediate impact? Things i worried were, in 
order:\nl) crazies\n2) enemies Iists\n3) subpoenas\n4) frivolous 
lawsuits/foias\n\nFrankly, though, i wouldn't worry TOO much 

a bout it. _ _ 

And you know anc know. But they might be cool 

enough not to run your name. _ 

How are you feeling about it? 

And we do need to discuss your role in 

Not sure if I 'm overt hinking that. _ 

And \U0001f60a something for to.brag about and to be 

roud of in a couple of generations._ 


I don't think I know a lot of enemies/crazies. Well, there is one 
I'm sure they won't hesitate to out me. They outed 
Who's the one? 

Who's 5 


You should be able to figure that out. \U0001f612 


A) they did? I didn't know that\nB) ah. Got it. \U0001f614 
So how are you feeling about it? Hopefully not too worried? 


Not happy about it, but obviously nothing I can do about it. 
Alright, I'm going 






\n\nGotta talk at all hands 

at 10 then at Agency at 1. Neither have anything to do with SC. 
Doing too many things poorly. Life is great. 


You should stay for the dull all hands. Sends a better message.

I'm sorry. That sucks. Im trying to reach Aaron about 

because we suck and won't have an answer until 
Itomorrow. sms 


Just talked to Bill, who had talked with Carl. Bill *thinks* Carl has 
spoken with Andy. Bill and are going to make the call to 

tomorrow then figure out how to get the material and 
see what's on there.\n\nNow going to go track down Aaron... 

Bill mentioned EADs and above are gone tomorrow at some 

leadershi p retreat \U0001f612. You going to talk to Andy? _ 

Frankly gotta say I'm curious what's been relayed to him... 

He is going too. But yes, I'll try to talk to him before hand. 


| We need to get Baker to do some award presentation for 



I agree. 

Have five things I don't have the figures for. Maybe I'll come back 
tonight..;_ 


I hope the meeting 

between Aaron and Carl resolves some of my uncertainty / stress. 


You shouldn't stay on, regardless of what happens. 

You're right, of course. \n\nWhat are you thinking about you? No 

change? _ 

I'm serious about you. Imagine the scene, head held high at the 30 
day mark, just a string handshake and a good luck. As opposed to 
a "can I pretty please sit in on these meetings?" F it Pete. You can 

do better than this. _ 

I know. \U0001f614 

Had the same thought when you sent me I don’t 

want a significant portion of my time spent tracking down stuff 
that should have been sent, or included, or invited, on behalf of 

the investigators. _ 

Exactly. I honestly think it is an easy decision, regardless of what 
comes next at Fbi. 


I'm grumpy 


Yup, join the club. 

I am starting to hedge off of my certainly that you should go.... 


Yeah but I don't have great options. Maybe I can do this for a

Hey you still at lunch or OSC? Have a sec? 

Hey there, sorry. Will be back at my desk in 2. 

K I'll swing by. Couple of things before my 3 

Just call? Everyone is going to be walking up before the 3. 

Ok lync 

Sorry, I've been over at SC since about 3:15. 



Definitely had to fight back tears with 
I just don't know what to do, Pete. 
Gmail you something? 


almost with Aaron. 



Been talking to Bill since we got off the phone. He really thinks 
insult go, provided I can be I'm the room. I told him about tonight 

and that I just didn't see that happening. _ 

Nevermind re gmail 

And again I return to the fact that you are having an hour long 
conversation about whether you should go is completely asinine. 

You misunderstand. I walked in there in the first thing I said was, 

I've decided I shouldn't go and don't want to g o._ 

Bill then asked if I wanted to trade with him. 


I know, \n\nl just dug the email draft out of deleted items and 
sent it. 


Thanks. \n\nSaw your politico article too. God help me I don't 

think I can take much more of this. _ 

I know 


Hey. See Aaron's email. My guess is that is intended to exclude 

me, but let's discuss before you say anything. _ 

I didnt see you on the cc line (thanks Samsung \U0001f612) and 
already told Aaron I would right now. I'll hedge in the wording and 
say there may be adds/drops, \n\nl'm sure this came about in the 
discussion I had the door closed in my face\U0001f621 

Or because of the nyt story saying that SC seems to be pursuing 

potus in light of these interviews. _ _ 

Wp had it first. And it's as likely to be leaking. 

All of which I would have walked through, if I had been in the 
room. Because, you know, media leaks and what I do for a living.

I guess. It's not that important. 

Hi. Hoping you got a chance to talk to Aaron about you. Of course 

want to hear abo ut it if you did. _ 

've been in with Aaron for the last two hours. 

I Another v/pru gnnH honest conversation. _ 

absolutely want to hear about your convo with 
Aaron. I'm glad it went well. Where did you end up?\n\n(other 

than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the olay?) _ 

Play. Olay is not a word. \U0001f621 


Not a clear answer but an honest conversation about what I want 
ideally. A definite commitment to hire a number 2 for the chief of 

staff role. _ 

A number 2 for you if you take it? Are you taking it? 

Maybe, maybe not. Honestly, were just going to try it out while 
still trying to keep me on team. And I got us both invited 

to the case deep dives they are doing every day this week. 




Thanks for the deep dives. I knew Andrew was going today but 
had our meeting as a conflict and didn't have a chance to say I 
should be there. _ 

Tiie only way I knew it was Forgot to mention. 

Frankly, forgot all about it. _ 

Now that I remember, it pisses me off. The FBI doesn't have a role 
in discussing the deep dives/path forward? 


|Yeah, well Aaron just forgot about you but immediately added 

you, I h as to Dush. ouite di rectly, for me. _ 

It does will be there in the future, and you/your

And I take all of the points you made 
labout my inability to control, prevent or even predict that. 


It doesn't NEED you. And I don't care if it does. Every conversation

begged you, not to. You do what you want. 

You have.
